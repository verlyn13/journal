- Keyboard shortcut (F key)
- Persistent state via localStorage
- Multi-tab synchronization via storage events
- Radial gradient overlay for visual calm

**4. Sidebar Component**

- Theme switcher (Dawn/Dusk)
- API integration for live data

**5. EntryList Component**

- Selection state management
- Loading states
- Empty state handling

## Styling Strategy

### Tailwind CSS v4.1.12

**Configuration**:
- Custom color palette (Sanctuary theme)
- Extended spacing and typography
- Forms and Typography plugins
- Dark mode via class strategy

**Utility-First Approach**:
- Inline utility classes for rapid development
- Component-specific CSS modules for complex styles
- Custom CSS for third-party library overrides

### CSS Architecture

**Token System** (`tokens.css`):
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Centralized color definitions
- Typography variables
- Radius and elevation tokens

**Component Styles**:
- BubbleToolbar.css: Floating toolbar styles
- SlashCommands.css: Command palette styles
- CodeBlockMonaco.css: Code editor integration

## State Management & Data Flow

### Server State (React Query)

**Query Keys Strategy**:
```typescript
const keys = {
  list: ["entries"] as const,
  item: (id: string) => ["entry", id] as const,
};
```

**Caching Configuration**:
- Stale time: 30 seconds
- Background refetching enabled
- Optimistic updates for mutations

### Local State Management

**Component State**:
- Selection state in JournalApp
- Focus mode toggle with persistence
- Theme preference with localStorage
- Editor content state

**Persistent State**:
- Theme preference: `journal:theme`
- Focus mode: `journal:focus`
- Cross-tab synchronization via storage events

## User Experience Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure
- Simple initial interface
- Advanced features accessible via slash commands
- Contextual toolbars appear on demand
- Settings hidden in sidebar

### Focus on Writing
- Minimal chrome in focus mode
- 70ch optimal reading width
- Smooth transitions (240ms standard)
- Keyboard-first interactions

### Visual Feedback
- Loading spinners for async operations
- Hover states on interactive elements
- Active state indicators
- Smooth color transitions

### Accessibility Considerations
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management in modals
- Semantic HTML structure
- Storybook a11y addon for testing

## Animation & Motion

**Transition System**:
- Duration: 240ms standard, 300ms for major transitions
- Timing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` (Sanctuary easing)
- Properties: opacity, transform, colors
- GPU-accelerated animations

**Interactive Elements**:
- Scale on click (95% active, 105% hover)
- Color transitions on state change
- Smooth focus mode transitions
- Gradient animations for ambiance

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Dynamic imports for Monaco editor
- Lazy loading of heavy dependencies
- Route-based splitting potential

### Rendering Optimizations
- React.memo for expensive components
- useCallback/useMemo for function stability
- Virtual scrolling potential for long lists

### Asset Optimization
- Vite's automatic chunking
- Manifest generation for cache busting
- Source maps in development only

## Development Workflow

### Component Development
- Storybook for isolated development
- Stories for each major component
- Visual regression testing capability
- Documentation generation

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Strict mode configuration
- Type inference for API responses
- Custom type definitions for domain models

## API Integration

### Service Layer (`api.ts`)
- Centralized API client
- Authentication handling
- Error management
- Type-safe responses

### Data Transformation
- View models separate from API models
- Mapper functions for data transformation
- Consistent data shapes across components

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoint Strategy
- Mobile-first approach implicit
- Three-pane layout collapses in focus mode
- Flexible grid system
- Max-width constraints for readability

### Touch Interactions
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Hover states disabled on touch devices
- Swipe gestures potential for navigation

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Component library structure in place
- Modular architecture supports growth
- State management can scale with Zustand/Redux
- API layer ready for GraphQL migration

### Internationalization
- Component structure supports i18n
- Separate content from presentation
- Theme system adaptable to RTL

### Performance Monitoring
- React Query DevTools integration
- Bundle size analysis with Vite
- Runtime performance profiling capability

## Conclusion

The Journal application demonstrates a mature, user-focused UI/UX strategy that prioritizes the writing experience while maintaining technical excellence. The architecture is well-structured for growth, with clear separation of concerns and modern tooling that supports rapid iteration. The dual-theme system and focus mode show deep consideration for user preferences and writing contexts. The use of TipTap for rich text editing provides a solid foundation for advanced editing features while maintaining simplicity in the user interface.
