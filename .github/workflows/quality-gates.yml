# Comprehensive Quality Gates Workflow
# 
# This workflow implements the V18 directive requirements for production-standard
# quality validation across the entire monorepo. It serves as the definitive
# quality gate for all code changes.
#
# Security: All steps use pinned actions and secure configurations.
# Performance: Optimized with caching and parallel execution.

# Quality Philosophy Documentation
# 
# This workflow embodies the V18 directive principles:
# 
# 1. **Zero CI Failures with Understanding**: Every failure provides
#    clear context and remediation steps.
# 
# 2. **Teaching Excellence**: Each check explains why it matters and
#    how to improve the code quality.
# 
# 3. **Security-First**: Security checks run first and block deployment
#    if critical issues are found.
# 
# 4. **The 96% Rule**: Quality thresholds are set to pragmatic levels
#    that encourage excellence without perfectionism paralysis.
# 
# 5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Validates code quality, type safety,
#    security, and performance across the entire monorepo.
