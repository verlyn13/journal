- **React Compiler**: Available with gradual rollout capability

## 🚀 Rollout Strategy (4-Week Plan)

### Phase 0: Pre-Production (Week 1)

**Goal**: Final validation and team preparation

**Actions**:
```bash
# Deploy to staging without React Compiler
./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh staging

./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh staging-opt
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All developers complete local testing
- [ ] Staging environment stable for 3+ days
- [ ] Performance metrics baseline captured
- [ ] Team training on rollback procedures completed

### Phase 1: Initial Production (Week 2)

**Goal**: 10% user rollout to validate production stability

**Actions**:
```bash
# Deploy with 10% React Compiler rollout
./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh prod-10 --metrics
```

**Configuration**:
- React Compiler: 10% of users via feature flag
- Monitoring: Enhanced error tracking and performance metrics
- Rollback: Immediate if error rate > 0.1%

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Error rate remains < 0.1% increase
- [ ] Core Web Vitals maintain current levels
- [ ] No critical user workflow issues reported
- [ ] Performance metrics show improvement or neutral impact

### Phase 2: Expanded Rollout (Week 3)

**Goal**: 50% user rollout with A/B testing

**Actions**:
```bash
# Deploy with 50% React Compiler rollout
./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh prod-50 --metrics
```

**Configuration**:
- React Compiler: 50% of users (A/B test vs 50% without)
- Analytics: Track user engagement and performance metrics
- Support: Monitor customer feedback channels

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] React Compiler users show improved performance metrics
- [ ] No regression in user engagement metrics
- [ ] Bundle size impact remains < 5%
- [ ] Development team reports positive experience

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 4)

**Goal**: 100% React Compiler deployment

**Actions**:
```bash
# Deploy with 100% React Compiler rollout
./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh prod-100 --metrics
```

**Configuration**:
- React Compiler: All users
- Optimization: Remove React 18 compatibility code
- Documentation: Update developer guides

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All users on React Compiler successfully
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable
- [ ] Development velocity maintained or improved

## 🎛️ Feature Flag Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Development

```bash
ENABLE_REACT_COMPILER=true
REACT_COMPILER_ROLLOUT_PERCENT=100
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Staging (Baseline)

```bash
ENABLE_REACT_COMPILER=false
DISABLE_REACT_COMPILER=true
REACT_COMPILER_ROLLOUT_PERCENT=0
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Production (10% Rollout)

```bash
ENABLE_REACT_COMPILER=false
DISABLE_REACT_COMPILER=false
REACT_COMPILER_ROLLOUT_PERCENT=10
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Production (Full Rollout)

```bash
ENABLE_REACT_COMPILER=false
DISABLE_REACT_COMPILER=false
REACT_COMPILER_ROLLOUT_PERCENT=100
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Manual Override Commands

```bash
# Force enable for specific testing
ENABLE_REACT_COMPILER=true bun run build

# Force disable for emergency rollback
DISABLE_REACT_COMPILER=true bun run build

# Test specific rollout percentage
REACT_COMPILER_ROLLOUT_PERCENT=25 bun run build
```

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track

#### Error Monitoring

- **React errors**: New error types or patterns
- **JavaScript errors**: Overall error rate changes  
- **Network errors**: API failures or timeouts
- **Build failures**: CI/CD pipeline stability

#### Performance Metrics

- **Core Web Vitals**: FCP, LCP, CLS, INP
- **Bundle size**: Track size changes over time
- **Build times**: Development and CI/CD performance
- **Runtime performance**: Component render times

#### User Experience  

- **Feature completion rates**: Entry creation, editing, deletion
- **User engagement**: Session duration, feature usage
- **Support tickets**: Volume and types of issues
- **User feedback**: In-app feedback and reviews

### Alerting Thresholds

#### Critical (Immediate Response)

- Error rate increase > 0.5%
- LCP increase > 30%
- Build pipeline failure rate > 5%

#### Warning (Monitor Closely)

- Error rate increase > 0.1%
- LCP increase > 15%
- Bundle size increase > 10%

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (< 15 minutes)

```bash
# Disable React Compiler immediately
DISABLE_REACT_COMPILER=true ./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh prod-0

# If needed, rollback to React 18 (extreme case)
git checkout main
./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh prod-0
```

### Gradual Rollback

```bash
# Reduce rollout percentage
./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh prod-10  # Back to 10%
./scripts/deploy-with-rollout.sh prod-0   # Complete disable
```

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue Severity | Response Time | Action |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Critical user-facing bug | Immediate | Emergency rollback |
| Performance regression > 20% | 1 hour | Gradual rollback |
| Error rate increase > 0.5% | 30 minutes | Emergency rollback |
| Error rate increase 0.1-0.5% | 2 hours | Gradual rollback |
| Minor issues | Next deployment | Fix forward |
