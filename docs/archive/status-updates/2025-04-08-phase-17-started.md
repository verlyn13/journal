# Phase 17 Started: Documentation Quality Assurance

Phase 17 of the Flask Journal project has officially commenced, following the successful completion of Phase 16. This phase focuses on implementing documentation testing procedures and creating initial user-focused documentation.

## Phase Goals

As outlined in the Phase 17 Implementation Plan, the primary goals are:

1. **Implement Documentation Testing:** Establish automated and manual processes to verify documentation quality.
2. **Develop User-Focused Documentation:** Create initial guides (installation, user guide, FAQ, troubleshooting) for end-users.

## Initial Tasks Delegated

The following tasks have been delegated to the **Documentation Specialist**:

1. **Documentation Testing Implementation:**

- Set up and configure a Markdown linter.
- Investigate and implement link validation.
- Define and document the documentation testing process (`docs/guides/documentation-testing-process.md`).
- Perform an initial validation run on key guides.

2. **User-Focused Documentation Creation:**

- Create initial versions of user guides within `docs/user-guide/`:
- `README.md` (Core Features Guide)
- `installation.md`
- `faq.md`
- `troubleshooting.md`

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, we expect to have:

- Established tools and processes for ensuring documentation quality (linting, link checking, review process).
- A foundational set of guides aimed at helping end-users install, use, and troubleshoot the application.

*Progress on these tasks will be tracked, and a completion status update will be provided once the phase goals are met.*
