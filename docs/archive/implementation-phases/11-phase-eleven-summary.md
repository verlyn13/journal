# Implementation Summary: Phase 11 - Editor MVP Feature Completion

## Overview

Phase 11 completed the core feature set for the CodeMirror editor as defined for the MVP. This involved expanding the toolbar with essential Markdown formatting controls and implementing the mechanism to clear locally stored drafts after successful entry submission.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Expanded Toolbar:**

- Buttons for Bold, Italic, Link, Unordered List, Ordered List, and Blockquote were added to the toolbar HTML (`toolbar.html`).
- Appropriate icons/labels and accessibility attributes were included.

2. **Toolbar Logic:**

- The `insertMarkdownSyntax` function in `toolbar-actions.js` was updated to handle the new formatting types.
- Logic correctly wraps selected text or inserts placeholder syntax with appropriate cursor positioning.

3. **Draft Clearing:**

- The `EditorPersistence` class now includes a `clearDraft()` method.
- The `editor` Alpine.js component detects successful form submissions (via flash messages) and calls `clearDraft()` to remove the relevant entry from `localStorage`.

4. **Testing:**

- Basic tests were added for the new toolbar action logic.

## Architectural Impact

- Provides users with standard Markdown formatting tools directly within the editor interface.
- Improves the draft persistence feature by preventing stale drafts from reappearing after successful submission.
- Completes the planned MVP functionality for the editor component.

## Conclusion

With the completion of Phase 11, the CodeMirror editor now possesses the essential features required for the MVP, including core formatting tools and reliable draft handling. This significantly enhances the user experience for creating and editing journal entries. Comprehensive manual testing is recommended before considering the MVP complete.
