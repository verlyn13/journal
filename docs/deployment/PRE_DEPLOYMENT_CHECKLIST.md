## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment
1. Create Vercel project
2. Set up Supabase database
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Run smoke tests

### Phase 2: Production Preparation
1. Final security audit
2. Performance testing
3. Load testing
4. Documentation review
5. Team sign-off

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
1. Database migration
2. Deploy API functions
3. Deploy frontend
4. Configure DNS
5. Monitor deployment

### Phase 4: Post-Deployment
1. Verify all functionality
2. Monitor error rates
3. Check performance metrics
4. Update documentation
5. Team retrospective

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] All tests passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] No critical security issues
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] API response time <200ms
- [ ] Page load time <3s

### Operational
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Backups automated
- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Runbook documented
- [ ] Team trained

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Data Loss**: Implement automated backups
2. **Security Breach**: Enable 2FA, audit logs
3. **Performance Issues**: Load testing, CDN
4. **Downtime**: Blue-green deployment
5. **Configuration Drift**: Infrastructure as Code

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Critical functionality broken
- Data corruption detected
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Performance degradation >50%

### Rollback Steps
1. Notify team via Slack
2. Revert Vercel deployment
3. Restore database backup
4. Clear CDN cache
5. Update status page
6. Post-mortem analysis
