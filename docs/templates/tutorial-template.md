## Step 1: First Task Name

Clear and concise description of the first step. Explain both what to do and why it's being done.

```python
# Example code for step 1
def example_function():
    return "This is step 1"
```

Expected outcome: Description of what should happen after completing this step, possibly with screenshots or output examples.

### Common Issues in Step 1

- Potential issue: How to resolve it
- Another potential issue: How to resolve it

## Step 2: Second Task Name

Clear and concise description of the second step.

```python
# Example code for step 2
def another_example():
    return "This is step 2"
```

Expected outcome: Description of what should happen after completing this step.

### Common Issues in Step 2

- Potential issue: How to resolve it
- Another potential issue: How to resolve it

## Step 3: Third Task Name

Clear and concise description of the third step.

```python
# Example code for step 3
def final_example():
    return "This is step 3"
```

Expected outcome: Description of what should happen after completing this step.

## Complete Solution

If applicable, provide the complete solution (full code, configuration, etc.) that combines all the steps.

```python
# Complete solution
def example_function():
    return "This is step 1"

def another_example():
    return "This is step 2"

def final_example():
    return "This is step 3"

# How they work together
def complete_solution():
    step1 = example_function()
    step2 = another_example()
    step3 = final_example()
    return f"{step1}, {step2}, {step3}"
```

## Testing the Solution

Explain how to verify that the solution works correctly.

```python
# Test code
def test_solution():
    result = complete_solution()
    assert "step 1" in result
    assert "step 2" in result
    assert "step 3" in result
    print("All tests passed!")
```

Expected output:

```
All tests passed!
```
