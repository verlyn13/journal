# Status Update: Phase 1 Complete (April 6, 2025)

Phase 1 of the Flask Journal MVP, focusing on **Project Setup & Core Authentication**, is now complete.

**Summary:**

- The basic Flask application structure is in place.
- Core dependencies are installed and managed in a virtual environment.
- Database (PostgreSQL) is initialized with a `User` model via Flask-Migrate.
- User registration, login, and logout functionality are implemented using Flask-Login and Flask-WTF.
- Basic templates are created.
- The development server is running successfully.

See the [Phase 1 Implementation Summary](../implementation/01-phase-one-summary.md) for full details, including issues encountered and resolved.

**Next Step:** Ready to proceed with planning for Phase 2 (Entry model and CRUD operations).
