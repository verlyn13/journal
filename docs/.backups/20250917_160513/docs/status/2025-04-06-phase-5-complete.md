# Status Update: Phase 5 Complete (April 6, 2025)

Phase 5 of the Flask Journal MVP, focusing on **Initial Testing & Basic Scripts**, is now complete.

**Summary:**

- Initial unit tests for models and forms have been implemented and are passing.
- Initial integration tests for authentication and core CRUD operations have been implemented and are passing after resolving several issues related to application context, database sessions, and assertion logic.
- Basic deployment (`scripts/deploy.sh`) and backup (`scripts/backup.sh`) helper scripts have been created and made executable.
- Test coverage has been established, providing a baseline for application stability.

See the [Phase 5 Implementation Summary](../implementation/05-phase-five-summary.md) for full details, including a breakdown of the testing challenges encountered and resolved.

**Next Step:** The core MVP features are implemented and tested. Proceed with final review, documentation updates (README), and manual deployment verification to conclude the MVP.
