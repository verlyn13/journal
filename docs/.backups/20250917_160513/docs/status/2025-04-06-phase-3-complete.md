# Status Update: Phase 3 Complete (April 6, 2025)

Phase 3 of the Flask Journal MVP, focusing on **UI Refinements**, is now complete.

**Summary:**

- Pagination has been implemented for the main journal entry list.
- Basic CSS styling has been applied for improved readability and layout.
- Markdown rendering is enabled for journal entry content display.
- The application's user interface is now more refined and user-friendly within the MVP scope.

See the [Phase 3 Implementation Summary](../implementation/03-phase-three-summary.md) for full details.

**Next Step:** Ready to proceed with planning for Phase 4 (e.g., deployment setup, basic testing infrastructure).
