## Overview

This document defines what "DONE" means for the Journal documentation system conversion. Every criterion must be met before declaring the documentation system production-ready.

## Core Requirements ✓

### 1. Structure & Organization
- [ ] All documents moved to new hierarchical directory structure
- [ ] No documents remaining in legacy locations
- [ ] All internal links updated and functional
- [ ] Redirects file created for moved documents
- [ ] Directory README.md files generated

### 2. Metadata & Frontmatter
- [ ] 100% of documents have valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] All required fields present (id, title, type, version, created, updated, author)
- [ ] All tags from controlled vocabulary (taxonomy.yaml)
- [ ] Document types correctly assigned
- [ ] Schema version specified (v1)

### 3. Schema Compliance
- [ ] 100% schema validation pass rate for Priority-1 docs (API, deployment, security)
- [ ] 95% schema validation pass rate for all other docs
- [ ] No critical validation errors
- [ ] All documents validate against current schema version (v1)

### 4. Content Quality
- [ ] All Priority-1 docs have required sections per type
- [ ] Semantic chunking (150-1000 tokens per section)
- [ ] All code blocks specify language
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] All internal links resolve correctly

### 5. Freshness & Maintenance
- [ ] API docs ≤ 30 days old
- [ ] Deployment docs ≤ 30 days old
- [ ] Security docs ≤ 30 days old
- [ ] Other docs ≤ 90 days old
- [ ] No docs > 180 days old

### 6. Relationships & Navigation
- [ ] relationships.json complete and accurate

- [ ] OpenAPI spec generated and current
- [ ] All endpoints have summaries and descriptions
- [ ] Request/response schemas documented
- [ ] Authentication documented

### 8. Generated Artifacts
- [ ] docs/_generated/index.json created
- [ ] docs/_generated/reports/ populated
- [ ] docs/INDEX.md generated
- [ ] API documentation generated from OpenAPI
- [ ] Coverage report shows >80% overall health

### 9. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] documentation-validate.yml using uv
- [ ] All validation scripts passing in CI
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed and working
- [ ] Documentation reports uploaded as artifacts
- [ ] No blocking errors in CI

### 10. Security & Privacy
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data in docs
- [ ] All examples use .env.schema pattern
- [ ] Anonymization scan shows 0 findings
- [ ] Visibility levels assigned correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (Blocking)
1. ✅ Zero schema errors for Priority-1 docs
2. ✅ 100% API documentation coverage
3. ✅ All internal links functional
4. ✅ CI validation passing
5. ✅ No secrets in documentation

### Should Have (Important)
1. ✅ >90% overall schema compliance
2. ✅ All documents have frontmatter
3. ✅ Relationships mapped
4. ✅ Index generated
5. ✅ Coverage >80%

### Nice to Have (Future)
1. ⏳ Vector search index
2. ⏳ Knowledge graph export
3. ⏳ Dashboard UI
4. ⏳ Automated snippet sync
5. ⏳ i18n support

## Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Run full validation
uv run python scripts/validate_docs.py

# 2. Check coverage
uv run python scripts/check_doc_coverage.py

# 3. Generate reports
uv run python scripts/generate_doc_report.py

# 4. Scan for secrets
uv run python scripts/anonymize_docs.py --scan

# 5. Generate API docs
uv run python scripts/generate_api_docs.py

# 6. Generate index
uv run python scripts/generate_doc_index.py

# 7. Run CI locally
act -j validate-structure

# 8. Test pre-commit
pre-commit run validate-docs --all-files
```
