# Implementation Summary: Phase 4

## Status: COMPLETE

Phase 4, focusing on **Deployment & Testing Setup**, has been successfully completed according to the plan outlined in [04-phase-four-deploy-test-setup.md](implementation/04-phase-four-deploy-test-setup.md).

## Key Deliverables

- **Deployment Setup:**
- `gunicorn` added to `requirements.txt` and installed.
- Manual Gunicorn execution confirmed working (`run:app` on port 8001).
- Systemd service file (`deployment/journal.service`) created with configuration for running the app via Gunicorn (using a Unix socket by default). *Note: Manual steps required by user to copy, enable, and start the service on the target machine.*
- **Testing Setup:**
- `uv run pytest` and `uv run pytest-cov` added to `requirements.txt` and installed.
- `tests/` directory structure created (`__init__.py`).
- `uv run pytest.ini` configuration file created.
- `TestingConfig` added to `config.py`.
- Basic Pytest fixtures (`test_app`, `test_client`, `db_session`) created in `tests/conftest.py` using the `TestingConfig` and an in-memory PostgreSQL database.
- Placeholder test file (`tests/test_basic.py`) created with basic checks for app and client fixtures.
- `uv run pytest` command successfully executed, verifying the setup and passing initial tests.
- **Bug Fix:** Resolved `AttributeError` in `inject_now` context processor by using `datetime.timezone.utc` instead of `datetime.UTC`. Confirmed fix by re-running `uv run pytest`.

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

1. **Missing Dependency:** `gunicorn` was not initially in `requirements.txt`.

- **Resolution:** Added `gunicorn` to `requirements.txt` and installed it.

2. **Port Conflict:** Manual Gunicorn test failed on port 8000 due to `Address already in use`.

- **Resolution:** Tested successfully on port 8001. Updated systemd file to use a Unix socket by default, avoiding common port conflicts.

3. **Pytest Failure (`AttributeError`):** Initial `uv run pytest` run failed due to incorrect usage of `datetime.UTC`.

- **Resolution:** Corrected the `inject_now` context processor in `journal/__init__.py` to use `datetime.timezone.utc`.

## Next Steps

The foundational setup for deployment and testing is complete. The project is ready for **Phase 5 planning**, which will focus on writing initial unit and integration tests and creating basic deployment/backup scripts, aligning with the final stages of the MVP scope.
