# Phase 17: Documentation Quality Assurance

With the core technical documentation enhanced and expanded, this phase focuses on ensuring its quality through testing and begins creating documentation targeted towards end-users.

## Goals

1. **Implement Documentation Testing:** Establish processes and tools to automatically and manually verify documentation quality, consistency, and accuracy.
2. **Develop User-Focused Documentation:** Create initial guides and resources aimed at helping end-users understand and utilize the Flask Journal application.

## Key Tasks

This phase involves two primary sets of tasks, delegated to the Documentation Specialist:

### Task 1: Documentation Testing Implementation

- **Objective:** Set up automated checks and defined processes for maintaining documentation quality.
- **Steps:**
- Research and select a suitable Markdown linter (e.g., `markdownlint-cli`) and configure it with project-specific rules (based on established standards). Add linting to `package.json` scripts.
- Investigate and potentially implement a link validation tool/script to check for broken internal (`@docs/...`) and external links within the documentation. Document the chosen approach.
- Define a formal documentation testing process, including steps for peer review, technical accuracy checks, and AI-assisted validation (e.g., prompting an AI to summarize or answer questions based *only* on a specific document). Document this process in `docs/guides/documentation-testing-process.md`.
- Perform an initial validation run using the implemented tools and processes on key documentation guides created in previous phases. Report findings.
- **Deliverable:** Configured Markdown linter, link validation approach/tool, `documentation-testing-process.md` guide, and an initial validation report.

### Task 2: User-Focused Documentation Creation

- **Objective:** Create foundational documentation aimed at end-users of the application.
- **Steps:**
- Create an initial End-User Guide (`docs/user-guide/README.md` or similar structure) covering core features:
- Registration and Login.
- Creating, Editing, and Deleting Journal Entries.
- Using the Markdown Editor (basic features).
- Applying and Filtering by Tags.
- Document the basic installation and setup process for local development (referencing existing setup scripts/docs if applicable) in `docs/user-guide/installation.md`.
- Create an initial FAQ document (`docs/user-guide/faq.md`) addressing potential common questions identified during development or based on application features.
- Develop a basic troubleshooting guide (`docs/user-guide/troubleshooting.md`) covering common issues like login problems or editor quirks.
- **Deliverable:** Initial versions of `README.md`, `installation.md`, `faq.md`, and `troubleshooting.md` within a `docs/user-guide/` directory.

## Coordination

- The **Documentation Specialist** will execute these tasks.
- The **Flask Lead Architect** will review the chosen testing tools, the defined testing process, and the structure/content of the user guides.
- The **Flask Specialist** might provide input on common user scenarios or potential troubleshooting points.

Completion of this phase will establish crucial quality assurance mechanisms for documentation and provide essential resources for end-users, improving the overall usability and maintainability of the project.
