# Implementation Summary: Phase 3

## Status: COMPLETE

Phase 3, focusing on **UI Refinements**, has been successfully completed according to the plan outlined in [03-phase-three-ui-refinements.md](implementation/03-phase-three-ui-refinements.md).

## Key Deliverables

- **Pagination:**
- `ENTRIES_PER_PAGE` configuration added to `config.py`.
- `index` route (`journal/main/routes.py`) updated to use Flask-SQLAlchemy's `paginate()` method.
- Pagination controls added to `journal/templates/index.html` using the pagination object.
- **Basic Styling:**
- Minimal CSS rules added to `journal/static/css/main.css` covering basic layout, forms, navigation, flash messages, and pagination.
- CSS file linked in `journal/templates/base.html`.
- **Markdown Rendering:**
- `Markdown` library added to `requirements.txt` and installed.
- `markdown` template filter registered in the application factory (`journal/__init__.py`).
- Filter applied to entry body rendering in `journal/templates/main/entry_detail.html` (using `| markdown | safe`).

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

- No significant issues were encountered during the implementation of Phase 3 itself. Previous issues related to environment variables, foreign keys, and context processors were resolved in Phase 2.

## Next Steps

The core UI has been refined with pagination, basic styling, and Markdown support. The project is ready for **Phase 4 planning**, which typically involves deployment setup (systemd) and initial testing infrastructure, aligning with the later stages of the MVP scope.
