# Implementation Summary: Phase 10 - Favicon Implementation

## Overview

Phase 10 addressed the missing application favicon by correctly configuring and serving the `favicon.ico` file.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Favicon Location:** The `favicon.ico` file was moved from the project root to the standard static assets directory (`journal/static/favicon.ico`).
2. **HTML Linking:** The base HTML template (`journal/templates/base.html`) was updated with the appropriate `<link rel="icon" ...>` tag within the `<head>` section, using `url_for('static', filename='favicon.ico')` to generate the correct URL.

## Architectural Impact

- Ensures standard browser behavior for displaying the site icon.
- Places static assets in the conventional location for Flask applications.

## Conclusion

Phase 10 was a small but necessary step to add the standard application favicon, improving browser integration and presentation.
