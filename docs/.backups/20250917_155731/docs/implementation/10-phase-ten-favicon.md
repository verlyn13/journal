# Implementation Plan: Phase 10 - Favicon Implementation

## Goal

The goal of this phase is to ensure the application's `favicon.ico` is correctly served and displayed by web browsers.

## Prerequisites

- The `favicon.ico` file exists in the project root directory (`/home/verlyn13/Projects/journal/`).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Move Favicon File:**

- **Action:** Move the `favicon.ico` file from the project root directory to the application's static assets directory.
- **Source:** `/home/verlyn13/Projects/journal/favicon.ico`
- **Destination:** `journal/static/favicon.ico`
- **Tool:** Likely requires `mv` command via `execute_command` (handled by the implementing mode).

2. **Update Base Template:**

- **File:** `journal/templates/base.html`
- **Action:** Add a `<link>` tag within the `<head>` section to reference the favicon.
- **Code:**
  `html     <link rel="icon" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='favicon.ico') }}">
      `
  *Self-Correction:* Using `rel="shortcut icon"` is common but `rel="icon"` is the modern standard and sufficient.\*
  *Placement:* Place this tag within the existing `<head>` section, for example, after the title or CSS links.

3. **Verification:**

- **Action:** Run the Flask development server (if not already running). Access the application homepage in a web browser.
- **Check:** Confirm that the journal's icon appears in the browser tab, address tag, or bookmark list as expected. Check the browser's developer console for any 404 errors related to the favicon.

## Testing Considerations

- Primarily manual verification by loading the application in one or more web browsers.

## Next Steps (Post-Phase 10)

- Proceed with further development or deployment tasks.
