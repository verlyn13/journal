# Implementation Summary: Phase 9 - Editor Refinement & Completion

## Overview

Phase 9 focused on stabilizing and completing the core functionality of the CodeMirror 6 editor integrated in Phase 8. This involved fixing critical bugs identified during initial testing and implementing the planned interactive features like live preview and toolbar actions.

## Key Features Implemented & Bugs Fixed

1. **View Mode Switching Fixed:**

- The bug causing the editor form to submit when clicking Edit/Split/Preview buttons was resolved. Buttons were confirmed to have `type="button"`, and event modifiers were likely used in the Alpine component (`@click.prevent`) to stop default form submission behavior.

2. **Live Preview Implemented:**

- The `updatePreview` function in the `editor` Alpine.js component now correctly fetches rendered HTML from the `/api/markdown` endpoint.
- Debouncing prevents excessive API calls while typing.
- The preview pane updates dynamically with the rendered content.
- MathJax is correctly re-triggered after content updates to render LaTeX.
- Error handling for the fetch request was implemented.

3. **Toolbar Actions Enabled:**

- The Image, Table, and Code Block buttons in the editor toolbar now function correctly.
- They trigger the `insertMarkdownSyntax` function, which modifies the CodeMirror editor content as expected.

4. **Alpine Component Refinement:**

- The `editor` Alpine.js component was reviewed, ensuring state management and initialization logic are sound.

5. **Basic Testing Added:**

- Initial integration tests were added for the Markdown preview API endpoint and to verify the editor component loads correctly on the entry forms.

## Architectural Impact

- Solidified the interaction pattern between the frontend Alpine.js component, the CodeMirror editor instance, and the backend preview API.
- Improved the reliability and usability of the core editor feature.

## Pending Items/Notes

- The logic to clear the local storage draft upon successful form submission (`editor.clearDraftOnSubmit()`) still needs to be added to the `create_entry.html` and `edit_entry.html` templates.

## Conclusion

Phase 9 successfully addressed the immediate bugs and completed the essential interactive features of the CodeMirror editor, bringing it much closer to the intended functionality outlined in the initial planning. The editor is now significantly more usable and stable. Further testing and the implementation of the draft clearing logic are the next steps.
