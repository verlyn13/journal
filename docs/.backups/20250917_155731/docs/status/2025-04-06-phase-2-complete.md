# Status Update: Phase 2 Complete (April 6, 2025)

Phase 2 of the Flask Journal MVP, focusing on **Journal Entry CRUD Operations**, is now complete.

**Summary:**

- The `Entry` model has been defined and integrated with the `User` model.
- Database migration for the `Entry` model has been successfully applied.
- Forms for creating and editing entries are implemented (`EntryForm`).
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) routes for journal entries are functional within the `main` blueprint.
- Templates for listing, viewing, creating, and editing entries have been created/updated.
- Access control ensures users can only manage their own entries.
- A bug related to the `now` variable in templates was fixed by making the context processor global.

See the [Phase 2 Implementation Summary](../implementation/02-phase-two-summary.md) for full details, including issues encountered and resolved during implementation.

**Next Step:** Ready to proceed with planning for Phase 3 (e.g., styling, pagination, etc., based on MVP scope).
