# Status Update: Phase 11 Complete

**Date:** 2025-04-08

**Phase:** 11 - Editor MVP Feature Completion

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Phase 11 successfully implemented the remaining essential features for the CodeMirror editor as defined for the MVP. This included expanding the toolbar with common formatting options and adding logic to clear local drafts upon successful entry submission.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Toolbar Expansion:** Buttons for Bold, Italic, Link, Unordered List, Ordered List, and Blockquote were added to the editor toolbar (`toolbar.html`).
- **Toolbar Logic:** The `insertMarkdownSyntax` function (`toolbar-actions.js`) was extended to handle the new formatting types, correctly modifying editor content.
- **Draft Clearing:**
- A `clearDraft()` method was added to the `EditorPersistence` class.
- The `editor` Alpine.js component (`alpine-component.js`) now checks for a success flash message upon initialization and calls `clearDraft()` if found.
- **Basic Testing:** Initial tests for the new toolbar actions were added.
- **Frontend Assets:** Assets were rebuilt (`bun run build`).

## Next Steps

- Perform comprehensive manual testing of all editor features, including the new toolbar buttons and the draft clearing mechanism.
- Address any bugs identified during testing.
- Consider the overall MVP completion status and plan for final deployment or any remaining minor tasks.
