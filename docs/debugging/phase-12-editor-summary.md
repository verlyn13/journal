# Debugging Summary: Phase 12 - Editor Bugfix & Layout Correction

This document summarizes the debugging process undertaken during Phase 12, focusing on resolving issues with the CodeMirror editor integration and related frontend build problems.

## Initial Goal

The primary objectives for Phase 12 were:

1. Fix the critical JavaScript error: "Editor target element (x-ref='editorElement') not found".
2. Correct the CSS layout of the editor toolbar to display buttons in a single row.

## Files Involved

The following files were modified or examined during this debugging process:

- `src/js/editor/alpine-component.js`: Alpine.js component managing editor state and initialization.
- `journal/templates/components/editor.html`: Jinja2 template containing the editor's HTML structure and Alpine directives (`x-data`, `x-ref`).
- `journal/templates/main/create_entry.html` / `edit_entry.html`: Parent templates including `editor.html`.
- `src/css/editor.css`: CSS rules for the editor and toolbar layout.
- `rollup.config.js` (later renamed to `rollup.config.cjs`): Rollup build configuration.
- `package.json`: npm scripts and dependencies.
- `journal/assets.py`: Initial Flask-Assets configuration (later removed).
- `journal/__init__.py`: Flask application factory, including asset loading logic.
- `journal/templates/base.html`: Base template linking CSS and JS assets.
- `scripts/update-manifest.js`: Post-build script created to manage asset manifest.
- `src/js/main.js`: Main JavaScript entry point, initializing Alpine.js.

## Issue 1: "editorElement not found" Error

- **Symptom:** JavaScript console error preventing CodeMirror from initializing because the target DOM element referenced by `x-ref="editorElement"` could not be found when the initialization code ran.
- **Attempt 1:** Wrap CodeMirror creation within `this.$nextTick()` inside the Alpine component's `init()` method (`alpine-component.js`). This is the standard way to ensure Alpine has processed initial DOM updates.
- **Result:** Error persisted. Console message: "Editor target element (x-ref='editorElement') still not found within $nextTick."
- **Attempt 2:** Remove the `x-show` directive from the `div` with `x-ref="editorElement"` in `editor.html`, hypothesizing it might interfere with `x-ref` registration timing. Visibility was already handled by CSS.
- **Result:** Error persisted, still referencing `$nextTick` in the console message. This indicated a deeper issue, likely related to stale code being executed.

## Issue 2: Cache Busting / Stale Code Execution

- **Observation:** The browser consistently returned a `304 Not Modified` status for the main JavaScript bundle (`packed.js`), and the console error message referenced `$nextTick`, even though the code had been changed to use a different initialization method (`x-init`). This strongly suggested the browser was executing cached, outdated JavaScript.
- **Attempt 1 (Filename Hashing):**
- Modify `rollup.config.js` to add `[hash]` to output filenames (`packed.[hash].js`, `packed.[hash].css`).
- Install and configure `rollup-plugin-output-manifest` to generate a `manifest.json` mapping original filenames to hashed versions.
- **Result:** Encountered multiple build errors related to importing the CommonJS `rollup-plugin-output-manifest` into the ES Module `rollup.config.js`. Iteratively fixed import syntax (`import X from`, `import { X } from`, `import pkg from; const { X } = pkg`, `const X = pkg.default || pkg`).
- **Result:** Encountered build errors because `__dirname` is unavailable in ES Module scope when used within plugin configurations (`postcss` extract path, manifest `generate` function).
- **Attempt 2 (CJS Config):**
- Rename `rollup.config.js` to `rollup.config.cjs`.
- Update `build` and `dev` scripts in `package.json` to use `rollup.config.cjs`.
- Convert `rollup.config.cjs` to use CommonJS syntax (`require`, `module.exports`), removing ES Module workarounds for `__dirname`.
- **Result:** Build errors persisted with `TypeError: outputManifest is not a function`, indicating the `require` method for the manifest plugin was still incorrect. Iteratively tried different `require` patterns (`require('...')`, `require('...').outputManifest`, `require('...').default || require('...')`).
- **Result:** Encountered internal `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'basePath')` within the manifest plugin, likely due to interactions with the `generate` function or `publicPath` option.
- **Attempt 3 (Post-build Script):**
- Simplify `outputManifest` config in `rollup.config.cjs` to only handle JS.
- Create `scripts/update-manifest.js` to run *after* Rollup. This script reads the JS-only manifest, finds the hashed CSS file generated by `postcss`, adds the CSS mapping, and rewrites `manifest.json`.
- Update `build` script in `package.json` to chain `node scripts/update-manifest.js`.
- **Result:** Build failed because `postcss` (with `extract: 'packed.[hash].css'`) was *not* generating a hashed filename; the post-build script found a literal `packed.[hash].css` file.
- **Attempt 4 (Fixed CSS Name + Query String - Final Solution):**
- Configure `postcss` in `rollup.config.cjs` to output a *fixed* CSS filename (`packed.css`).
- Simplify `scripts/update-manifest.js` to be a no-op (manifest plugin handles JS correctly).
- Modify the Flask `asset_url` context processor in `journal/__init__.py`:
- Read `manifest.json`.
- For JS (`main.js`), look up the hashed filename (e.g., `packed.[hash].js`) and prepend `gen/`.
- For CSS (`main.css`), use the fixed path (`gen/packed.css`) and append the *JS file's hash* as a query string (`?v=[hash]`).
- Update `journal/templates/base.html` to use `asset_url('main.css')` and `asset_url('main.js')`.
- **Result:** Build succeeded. Initial page load resulted in 404s for assets.
- **Fix:** Corrected path logic within `asset_url` in `journal/__init__.py` (ensured `gen/` prefix was added correctly to JS path from manifest, used correct output CSS filename `packed.css`).
- **Result:** Build succeeded, Flask server reloaded, 404 errors resolved, assets loaded with correct cache-busting.

## Issue 3: "editorElement not found" Error (Revisited)

- **Observation:** Despite fixing cache-busting and asset loading, the original error *still* appeared in the console, referencing `$nextTick`, even though the loaded code used a different initialization strategy (`x-init`).
- **Attempt 1 (Deferred Alpine Registration):** Modify `src/js/main.js` to register the Alpine component within a `document.addEventListener('alpine:init', ...)` callback, ensuring Alpine itself is fully initialized first. Keep the `$nextTick` wrapper inside the component's `init`.
- **Result:** Error persisted, still referencing `$nextTick`.
- **Attempt 2 (Revert to x-init):** Revert `main.js`. Change `alpine-component.js` to remove editor init from `init()` and create `initializeCodeMirror(element)`. Change `editor.html` to add `x-init="initializeCodeMirror($el)"` to the target div.
- **Result:** New error `Uncaught TypeError: n is undefined` during Alpine initialization. Toolbar layout also broke.
- **Attempt 3 (Revert x-init, Keep alpine:init):** Revert `alpine-component.js` and `editor.html` back to the state after Attempt 1 (using `alpine:init` and `$nextTick`).
- **Result:** Error persisted, still referencing `$nextTick`.

## Issue 4: Editor Rendering Incorrectly ("black box", "]]>")

- **Observation:** After finally resolving the "editorElement not found" error (by forcing a clean build and ensuring correct code execution), the editor rendered as an unresponsive black box, sometimes showing "]]>" characters. The toolbar layout was also broken again (buttons stacked vertically).
- **Hypothesis:** Incorrect escaping or parsing of the `initial_content` passed from Jinja to the Alpine component's JavaScript context.
- **Attempt 1 (tojson filter):** Change `{{ initial_content | escape | replace('`', '\\`') }}` to `{{ initial_content | tojson | safe }}` within the `x-data` attribute in `editor.html`.
- **Result:** Introduced new JavaScript syntax errors (`expected expression, got '}'`) and Alpine errors (`mode is not defined`), indicating the `tojson` output wasn't compatible with direct embedding in `x-data`.
- **Attempt 2 (data-* attribute):*\* Move content passing to `data-initial-content="{{ initial_content | tojson | safe }}"`. Update `alpine-component.js` to read from `this.$el.dataset.initialContent`.
- **Result:** Still broken (specific errors not captured, but led to next attempt).
- **Attempt 3 (script tag + JSON):** Move content into `<script type="text/template" id="initial-content-...">{{ initial_content | tojson | safe }}</script>`. Update JS to find script tag by ID and use `JSON.parse(scriptTag.textContent)`.
- **Result:** Still broken (specific errors not captured, but led to next attempt).
- **Attempt 4 (script tag + raw text):** Change script tag content to `{{ initial_content }}` (relying on default Jinja HTML escaping). Update JS to read raw `scriptTag.textContent` without `JSON.parse`.
- **Result:** Still broken ("black box", "]]>").

## Current Status (as of 2025-04-08 11:29 AM)

- **Fixed:**
- Toolbar layout CSS (`src/css/editor.css`).
- Asset cache-busting mechanism (`rollup.config.cjs`, `__init__.py`, `base.html`).
- "editorElement not found" error (resolved by ensuring correct code execution via clean build and cache clearing, combined with `alpine:init` + `$nextTick` timing).
- **Remaining Issue:** The editor renders incorrectly as an unresponsive black box, often displaying "]]>" characters. This indicates a persistent issue with how the initial content (either from the server or potentially a draft, although draft loading was disabled in the last step) is being processed or rendered by CodeMirror/Alpine, despite trying multiple methods for passing the data from Jinja to JavaScript. The toolbar layout is also currently broken (stacked vertically), suggesting a potential CSS conflict or JS error preventing proper rendering.
- **Last Code State:**
- `alpine-component.js`: Uses `$nextTick` in `init`, draft loading commented out.
- `editor.html`: Uses `<script type="text/template">` with default Jinja escaping.
- `main.js`: Uses `alpine:init` event listener for component registration.

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Content:** Examine the exact `initial_content` being passed from the server for problematic character sequences or structures.
2. **Simplify CodeMirror Setup:** Temporarily remove extensions (like Markdown parsing, themes) from the `createEditor` function in `src/js/editor/setup.js` to see if a barebones CodeMirror instance renders the content correctly.
3. **Inspect Toolbar CSS:** Re-investigate `src/css/editor.css` and potentially `src/css/main.css` to understand why the toolbar layout regressed. Check for conflicting styles or errors preventing flexbox from applying correctly.
4. **Review `createEditor`:** Analyze the `src/js/editor/setup.js` file for potential issues in how the CodeMirror state or view is constructed with the initial content and extensions.
