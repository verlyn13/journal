*   **[implementation/](./implementation/)**: Contains detailed, step-by-step implementation plans for specific features or components, breaking down the initial plans into actionable tasks.
*   **[status/](./status/)**: Tracks the overall progress and status of the project, including reports, checklists, and key decisions.
*   **[guides/](./guides/)**: Contains practical guides for developers, covering topics like architecture, specific integrations (CodeMirror), standards (JSDoc, Docstrings), and tools ([GitHub CLI](./guides/gh-cli.md)).

*   **[roo-code/](./roo-code/)**: Contains documentation related to the usage of Roo Code for this project, including tool guides, workflow examples, and custom configurations.
