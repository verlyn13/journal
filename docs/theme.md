### **‚úíÔ∏è Typography**

Typography is central to the Sanctuary theme, chosen to make writing a pleasure and reading effortless.

* **UI & Headings (Sans-Serif): `Inter`**
    * Clean, modern, and exceptionally legible for all UI elements, from buttons to menu items. Its neutral yet friendly character keeps the interface uncluttered.
* **Body Text (Serif): `Lora`**
    * A classic, well-balanced serif with gentle curves that is perfect for long-form reading. It renders beautifully on screens, reducing eye strain and adding a touch of literary elegance to the user's entries.

### **üìê Layout, Spacing, & Iconography**

* **Layout:** The three-pane layout is embraced, but with an emphasis on **generous negative space**. Padding is increased around text and between UI elements to create a breathable, uncluttered feel.
* **Spacing:** A consistent 8px grid system is used for all margins, padding, and positioning to ensure visual harmony and rhythm throughout the application.
* **Iconography:** Icons are **minimalist and line-based (outline style)**, using a consistent, thin stroke weight. They are functional but unobtrusive, ensuring the user's content remains the hero of the experience.

### **‚ú® Micro-interactions & Animations**

Animations are subtle and purposeful, designed to enhance the feeling of calm, not distract.

* **Fade Transitions:** When swapping content via HTMX, elements gently fade in and out (`opacity` and `transform` transitions) rather than snapping into place.
* **Subtle Hovers:** Interactive elements subtly change background color or scale up slightly on hover, providing clear feedback without sharp, jarring movements.
* **Focus Mode:** A dedicated "Zen Mode" button is present. When clicked, all UI elements gracefully fade away, leaving only the user, their text, and the soft background color for a truly immersive writing experience.

This **Sanctuary** theme provides a magnificent and beautiful foundation for the journaling application, directly translating the strategic blueprint into a tangible, elegant user experience.
