# Phase 18 Started: Documentation Integration

Phase 18 of the Flask Journal project has officially commenced, following the successful completion of Phase 17. This final documentation-focused phase aims to integrate documentation practices into the core development workflow.

## Phase Goals

As outlined in the [Phase 18 Implementation Plan](@docs/implementation/18-phase-eighteen-documentation-integration.md), the primary goals are:

1.  **Formalize Documentation Review Process:** Define how documentation changes are reviewed alongside code.
2.  **Plan CI/CD Integration:** Outline how automated documentation checks (linting, links) can be added to the CI/CD pipeline.
3.  **Define Documentation Maintenance Strategy:** Establish guidelines, checklists, and metrics for keeping documentation current.

## Initial Tasks Delegated

The following tasks have been delegated to the **Documentation Specialist**:

1.  **Formalize Review Process:**
-   Update/create guides (`docs/guides/documentation-testing-process.md` or `docs/guides/documentation-review-process.md`) detailing review steps, responsibilities, and checklists.
2.  **Plan CI/CD Integration:**
-   Create a proposal document (`docs/proposals/ci-cd-documentation-checks.md`) outlining commands, placement, and handling for automated checks.
3.  **Define Maintenance Strategy:**
-   Create a `Documentation Update Checklist` (`docs/guides/documentation-update-checklist.md`).
-   Define and document documentation health metrics (`docs/guides/documentation-metrics.md`).
-   Outline a process for periodic documentation audits.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, we expect to have:

-   Clearly defined processes for reviewing and maintaining documentation as part of the development lifecycle.
-   A concrete plan for integrating automated documentation checks into the CI/CD pipeline.
-   Tools (checklists, metrics) to support ongoing documentation maintenance and quality.

*Progress on these tasks will be tracked, and a completion status update will be provided once the phase goals are met. This phase focuses on process definition rather than direct documentation creation.*
