# Phase 15 Started: Core Documentation Enhancement

Phase 15 of the Flask Journal project has officially commenced, following the successful completion of Phase 14. This phase focuses on enhancing core API documentation and creating standardized documentation templates.

## Phase Goals

As outlined in the [Phase 15 Implementation Plan](@docs/implementation/15-phase-fifteen-core-documentation.md), the primary goals are:

1.  **Improve API Documentation:** Enhance documentation for Flask routes, API endpoints, authentication, and data models.
2.  **Standardize Documentation Formats:** Create reusable Markdown templates for various documentation types.

## Initial Tasks Delegated

The following tasks have been delegated to the **Documentation Specialist**:

1.  **API Documentation Improvement:**
    *   Review and enhance Python docstrings in route files (`journal/api/`, `journal/auth/`, `journal/main/`).
    *   Create/update comprehensive guides: `api-reference.md`, `authentication.md`, `data-model.md`.
    *   Ensure clear documentation of endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and error handling.
2.  **Documentation Templates Creation:**
    *   Develop standard Markdown templates for concept guides, API references, component docs, tutorials, and troubleshooting guides in `docs/templates/`.
    *   Include standard YAML frontmatter and placeholder content.
    *   Create a guide (`docs/guides/documentation-templates.md`) on using the templates.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, we expect to have:

*   Significantly improved and more comprehensive documentation for the core Flask application logic and API.
*   A set of standardized Markdown templates to ensure consistency and quality in future documentation efforts.
*   Clear guidelines on how to use the new documentation templates.

*Progress on these tasks will be tracked, and a completion status update will be provided once the phase goals are met. Collaboration with the Flask Specialist may be required for API details.*
