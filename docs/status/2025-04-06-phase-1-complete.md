*   Database (SQLite) is initialized with a `User` model via Flask-Migrate.
*   User registration, login, and logout functionality are implemented using Flask-Login and Flask-WTF.
*   Basic templates are created.
*   The development server is running successfully.

See the [Phase 1 Implementation Summary](../implementation/01-phase-one-summary.md) for full details, including issues encountered and resolved.
