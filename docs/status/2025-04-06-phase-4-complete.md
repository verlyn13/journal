# Status Update: Phase 4 Complete (April 6, 2025)

Phase 4 of the Flask Journal MVP, focusing on **Deployment & Testing Setup**, is now complete.

**Summary:**

- Gunicorn has been added as a dependency and confirmed to work with the application.
- A systemd service file (`deployment/journal.service`) has been created to facilitate running the application as a service (requires manual activation on target machine).
- Pytest and Pytest-Cov have been installed.
- The basic testing structure (`tests/` directory, `pytest.ini`, `tests/conftest.py`) has been established.
- Initial Pytest fixtures for the test application and client are configured using an in-memory database.
- Placeholder tests pass, confirming the testing framework setup.

See the [Phase 4 Implementation Summary](../implementation/04-phase-four-summary.md) for full details, including issues encountered and resolved.

**Next Step:** Ready to proceed with planning for Phase 5 (writing initial tests, creating basic deployment/backup scripts).
