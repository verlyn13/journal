# Phase 16 Started: Documentation Expansion

Phase 16 of the Flask Journal project has officially commenced, following the successful completion of Phase 15. This phase focuses on expanding documentation coverage through Python docstring standardization and the addition of visual documentation elements.

## Phase Goals

As outlined in the [Phase 16 Implementation Plan](@docs/implementation/16-phase-sixteen-documentation-expansion.md), the primary goals are:

1.  **Standardize Python Docstrings:** Establish and apply consistent docstring standards across the Python codebase.
2.  **Introduce Visual Documentation:** Create diagrams for key architectural components and workflows.

## Initial Tasks Delegated

The following tasks have been delegated to the **Documentation Specialist**:

1.  **Python Docstring Standardization:**
    *   Define and document Python docstring standards (e.g., in `docs/guides/python-docstring-standards.md`).
    *   Systematically review and update docstrings in key Python modules (models, forms, core logic).
    *   Investigate and report on potential docstring automation/validation tools.
2.  **Visual Documentation Addition:**
    *   Identify key areas for visual documentation (architecture, flows, data model).
    *   Choose and document a diagramming approach (e.g., Mermaid).
    *   Create and integrate diagrams into relevant Markdown documents.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, we expect to have:

*   Established standards for Python docstrings and applied them to key parts of the codebase.
*   A set of visual diagrams integrated into the documentation, clarifying complex system aspects.
*   An understanding of potential tools for maintaining docstring quality.

*Progress on these tasks will be tracked, and a completion status update will be provided once the phase goals are met. Collaboration with other specialists may be needed for diagram accuracy.*
