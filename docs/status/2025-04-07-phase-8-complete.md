# Status Update: Phase 8 Complete

**Date:** 2025-04-07

**Phase:** 8 - CodeMirror Editor Integration

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

The implementation of Phase 8 is complete. The core objective of replacing the standard textarea with the CodeMirror 6 editor has been achieved.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Frontend Build Process:** Established using `npm`, Rollup, and PostCSS. Dependencies installed and build configuration (`rollup.config.js`) created.
- **Flask-Assets Integration:** Configured to manage and serve the bundled frontend assets (`journal/static/dist/bundle.js`, `journal/static/dist/bundle.css`).
- **CodeMirror Core:** Implemented the core editor setup (`src/js/editor/setup.js`), theme (`theme.js`), toolbar actions (`toolbar-actions.js`), and basic persistence (`persistence.js`).
- **Alpine.js Integration:** The `editor` component (`alpine-component.js`) successfully manages CodeMirror initialization, state (mode, content, preview), toolbar interactions, and preview updates.
- **Backend Preview API:** A new API endpoint (`/api/v1/markdown`) was created to render Markdown text to HTML server-side.
- **Markdown & LaTeX:** Editor supports Markdown input, and the preview pane renders Markdown correctly, including LaTeX via MathJax integration.
- **Styling:** Basic styling for the editor container, toolbar, and panes implemented (`src/css/editor.css`), adhering to the project's aesthetic.
- **Template Integration:** The editor component (`components/editor.html`, `components/toolbar.html`) is integrated into the entry creation (`create_entry.html`) and editing (`edit_entry.html`) forms.
- **Frontend Assets Built:** The initial build of frontend assets was successful.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to the next planned phase (if any) or final testing/review.
- Address any minor bugs or required refinements identified during testing.
- Consider implementing post-MVP editor features outlined in the planning documents (e.g., PDF export, image uploads).
