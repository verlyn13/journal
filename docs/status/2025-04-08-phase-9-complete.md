# Status Update: Phase 9 Complete

**Date:** 2025-04-08

**Phase:** 9 - Editor Refinement & Completion

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Phase 9 addressed bugs and completed the core interactive features of the CodeMirror editor integrated in Phase 8. The editor is now more functional and robust.

## Key Accomplishments

*   **View Mode Switching:** The bug causing premature form submission when clicking Edit/Split/Preview buttons was fixed by ensuring buttons have `type="button"` and potentially using event modifiers (`@click.prevent`).
*   **Live Preview:** The Alpine.js component now correctly fetches rendered Markdown/MathJax from the `/api/v1/markdown` endpoint, handles the response, updates the preview pane dynamically, and triggers MathJax typesetting. Debouncing is implemented.
*   **Toolbar Actions:** The Image, Table, and Code Block toolbar buttons are now connected to the `insertMarkdownSyntax` function and correctly modify the editor content.
*   **Alpine Component Review:** The `editor` component logic was reviewed for clarity and state management.
*   **Basic Testing:** Initial integration tests were added for the preview API and editor component loading.
*   **Frontend Assets:** Assets were rebuilt (`npm run build`).

## Notes

*   The Editor Specialist noted that `editor.clearDraftOnSubmit()` should be called upon successful form submission in `create_entry.html` and `edit_entry.html` to clear the locally stored draft. This needs to be implemented separately.

## Next Steps

*   Implement the draft clearing logic noted above.
*   Proceed with comprehensive manual testing of the editor functionality.
*   Address any further bugs identified during testing.
*   Plan for the next development phase or final deployment preparations.
