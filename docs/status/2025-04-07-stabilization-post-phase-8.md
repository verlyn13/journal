# Status Update: Stabilization Post-Phase 8

**Date:** 2025-04-07

**Phase:** Stabilization (Post-Phase 8)

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Following the completion of Phase 8 (Editor Integration), several warnings, test failures, and a CSS loading error (404) were identified during build, test execution, and runtime. This stabilization effort addressed these issues to ensure a clean build, a fully passing test suite, and correct asset loading.

## Issues Addressed

1.  **Rollup Build Errors/Warnings:**
    *   **Error:** `Invalid value "iife" for option "output.format"` and `Invalid value for option "output.file"` were resolved by modifying `rollup.config.js` to use `output.dir` and the `es` format without `inlineDynamicImports`, correctly enabling code splitting for CodeMirror.
    *   **Warning:** `The emitted file "bundle.css" overwrites a previously emitted file` was resolved by adjusting the `output.file` setting for the CSS build target in `rollup.config.js` to avoid conflicting with the `postcss` plugin's `extract` option.
    *   **Runtime Error (404):** A `404 Not Found` error for `/static/gen/editor.css` was resolved by adding `postcss-import` to the PostCSS plugin chain in `rollup.config.js` to correctly inline the `@import url('./editor.css');` rule from `src/css/main.css` into the final `bundle.css`.

2.  **Pytest Failures/Warnings:**
    *   **Failure:** `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` in unit tests was resolved by modifying the datetime comparisons in `tests/unit/test_models.py` to use naive UTC datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(tzinfo=None)`) for comparing against the database's naive timestamps.
    *   **Warning:** `LegacyAPIWarning: The Query.get() method is considered legacy` was resolved by updating the Flask-Login `user_loader` in `journal/__init__.py` to use `db.session.get()`.
    *   **Warning:** `SAWarning: Object of type <...> not in session` in routes and tests was resolved by ensuring database objects were added to the session (`db.session.add()`) *before* operations that could trigger SQLAlchemy's autoflush mechanism.
    *   **Warning:** `DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated` originating from SQLAlchemy internals was filtered by adding a specific ignore rule to `pytest.ini`.

## Outcome

The frontend build process (`npm run build`) now completes without errors or warnings. The test suite (`pytest`) now passes all tests without failures or warnings. Asset loading in the browser is functioning correctly. The project is in a more stable state.

## Next Steps

Proceed with manual testing of the application as previously planned.
