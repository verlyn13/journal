# Status Update: Phase 6 Complete (Tags Functionality)

**Date:** 2025-04-07

**Phase:** 6 - Tags Functionality

**Status:** **Complete**

**Summary:**

The implementation of tag functionality for journal entries is complete. Users can now add comma-separated tags when creating or editing entries. Tags are displayed on the entry detail page and the main entry list, with links allowing users to filter the list by a specific tag.

**Key Activities:**

*   Created `Tag` model and many-to-many relationship with `Entry`.
*   Updated forms, routes, and templates to support tag input, display, and filtering.
*   Updated and added unit/integration tests.
*   Resolved a persistent testing issue related to timestamp comparisons by standardizing on naive UTC timestamps for model defaults and test assertions.

**Next Steps:**

*   Plan the next phase of development (if any).
