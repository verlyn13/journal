# Project Changelog

All project status updates and milestones.

## Updates

### 2025-09-10
# User Management — Status (2025-09-10)

This snapshot reflects the current reality in-code and branches for the user management upgrade.

## Branches / PRs

- PR #19 → `feat/auth-M4.T1-cookie-refresh`
  - Cookie-based refresh (flagged), CSRF helpers, refresh rotation, server-side sessions
  - Import paths standardized (`from app.infra.cookies ...`), endpoint signatures sane (no optional Request/Response)
  - Web autosave test seam added (`autosaveMs`, `__TEST__`) — deterministic unit

- PR #20 → `feat/auth-metrics`
  - Metrics-only deltas layered on top of #19 (`login_success/login_fail/refresh_rotated/session_revoked`)
  - `apps/api/app/api/auth.py` has no conflict markers and matches #19 behavior + counters

## Code Health

- API
  - Models present: `User`, `UserSession` (SQLAlchemy 2.0 typed) and rotation flow is implemented
  - Cookie helpers in `app.infra.cookies` and session helpers in `app.infra.sessions`
  - Settings: `user_mgmt_enabled`, `auth_cookie_refresh`, CSRF/refresh cookie names and attributes
  - Mypy scoped to `app/` via `apps/api/mypy.ini`; tests excluded short‑term
  - Pre-commit hooks enabled at repo root (merge-conflict detection, ruff, format, biome)

- Web
  - Autosave tests stable; component exposes `autosaveMs` and uses test‑friendly scheduling
  - Client persists rotated refresh tokens when provided (cookie path planned behind flag)

## Remaining Work (to close #19/#20)

1) Merge order
   - Land #19 first; re-run CI
   - Rebase `feat/auth-metrics` on `main` and merge #20 once #19 is green

2) Configuration/Docs
   - Ensure CONTRIBUTING uses uv/bun flows (legacy pip/bun mentions remain in top sections)
   - Optionally add short README in `docs/status/` pointing to this file and `USER_MANAGEMENT_ORCHESTRATEV9.md`

3) Next feature tickets (post-merge)
   - Frontend: switch to cookie refresh when `auth_cookie_refresh` is enabled; stop storing refresh in localStorage; echo CSRF header
   - Sessions UI endpoints (`/auth/sessions`, revoke specific session)
   - Ownership enforcement across entries update/delete; tests
   - Optional providers (OAuth/WebAuthn), RBAC

## Cleanup Recommendations

- Keep only `USER_MANAGEMENT_ORCHESTRATEV9.md` as source of truth for sequencing; leave earlier versions as archive
- Remove or quarantine ad‑hoc debug helpers not used in CI (e.g., `apps/api/test_debug.py`) if no longer needed
- Avoid committing coverage artifacts (`apps/web/coverage`, `apps/api/htmlcov`) in future — consider `.gitignore` update in a separate housekeeping PR

## Quick Verifications

- No conflict markers in `apps/api/app/api/auth.py`
- Cookie imports use `from app.infra.cookies ...`
- Integration tests: `cd apps/api && uv run pytest -m integration -q` (requires local DB services)

# Status Update: Phase 9 Complete

**Date:** 2025-04-08

**Phase:** 9 - Editor Refinement & Completion

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Phase 9 addressed bugs and completed the core interactive features of the CodeMirror editor integrated in Phase 8. The editor is now more functional and robust.

## Key Accomplishments

- **View Mode Switching:** The bug causing premature form submission when clicking Edit/Split/Preview buttons was fixed by ensuring buttons have `type="button"` and potentially using event modifiers (`@click.prevent`).
- **Live Preview:** The Alpine.js component now correctly fetches rendered Markdown/MathJax from the `/api/markdown` endpoint, handles the response, updates the preview pane dynamically, and triggers MathJax typesetting. Debouncing is implemented.
- **Toolbar Actions:** The Image, Table, and Code Block toolbar buttons are now connected to the `insertMarkdownSyntax` function and correctly modify the editor content.
- **Alpine Component Review:** The `editor` component logic was reviewed for clarity and state management.
- **Basic Testing:** Initial integration tests were added for the preview API and editor component loading.
- **Frontend Assets:** Assets were rebuilt (`bun run build`).

## Notes

- The Editor Specialist noted that `editor.clearDraftOnSubmit()` should be called upon successful form submission in `create_entry.html` and `edit_entry.html` to clear the locally stored draft. This needs to be implemented separately.

## Next Steps

- Implement the draft clearing logic noted above.
- Proceed with comprehensive manual testing of the editor functionality.
- Address any further bugs identified during testing.
- Plan for the next development phase or final deployment preparations.

# Status Update: Phase 11 Complete

**Date:** 2025-04-08

**Phase:** 11 - Editor MVP Feature Completion

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Phase 11 successfully implemented the remaining essential features for the CodeMirror editor as defined for the MVP. This included expanding the toolbar with common formatting options and adding logic to clear local drafts upon successful entry submission.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Toolbar Expansion:** Buttons for Bold, Italic, Link, Unordered List, Ordered List, and Blockquote were added to the editor toolbar (`toolbar.html`).
- **Toolbar Logic:** The `insertMarkdownSyntax` function (`toolbar-actions.js`) was extended to handle the new formatting types, correctly modifying editor content.
- **Draft Clearing:**
- A `clearDraft()` method was added to the `EditorPersistence` class.
- The `editor` Alpine.js component (`alpine-component.js`) now checks for a success flash message upon initialization and calls `clearDraft()` if found.
- **Basic Testing:** Initial tests for the new toolbar actions were added.
- **Frontend Assets:** Assets were rebuilt (`bun run build`).

## Next Steps

- Perform comprehensive manual testing of all editor features, including the new toolbar buttons and the draft clearing mechanism.
- Address any bugs identified during testing.
- Consider the overall MVP completion status and plan for final deployment or any remaining minor tasks.

# CodeMirror Documentation Integration

## Overview

The CodeMirror documentation has been successfully integrated into the project's documentation structure. This enables developers to efficiently navigate both the official CodeMirror references and the application-specific implementation details.

## Completed Work

1. **Documentation Index Created**: Added a comprehensive index file (`docs/code-mirror/README.md`) that organizes all CodeMirror documentation with contextual information about how it relates to the Journal application.

2. **Quick Reference Guide Added**: Created a practical quick reference guide (`docs/code-mirror/quick-reference.md`) containing code examples for common operations organized by functionality.

3. **Documentation Inventory Updated**: Updated the documentation inventory to include assessments of all CodeMirror documentation files.

4. **Integration Guide Developed**: Created a new guide (`docs/guides/codemirror-integration.md`) that maps the official CodeMirror concepts to our specific implementation, including code examples, customization scenarios, and troubleshooting strategies.

## Benefits

- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand how CodeMirror is used in the project
- **Easier Maintenance**: Clear connections between official documentation and implementation code
- **Better Troubleshooting**: Specific guidance for debugging CodeMirror-related issues
- **Consistent Development**: Established patterns for extending editor functionality

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is now organized as follows:

```
docs/
├── code-mirror/           # Official CodeMirror reference documentation
│   ├── README.md          # Index and overview
│   ├── quick-reference.md # Practical code snippets
│   ├── reference-manual-* # Detailed API documentation
│   ├── example-*.md       # Implementation examples
│   ├── extensions-*.md    # Extensions documentation
│   └── system-guide.md    # Architecture overview
└── guides/
    ├── editor-architecture.md     # Journal editor architecture
    └── codemirror-integration.md  # Connection between CodeMirror and Journal
```

## Next Steps

1. Add JSDoc comments to all editor-related JavaScript files to ensure code-level documentation is consistent with the higher-level guides
2. Create visual diagrams showing the relationship between CodeMirror components and the Journal application
3. Develop tutorials for common editor customization tasks specific to the Journal application

# Status Update: Stabilization Post-Phase 8

**Date:** 2025-04-07

**Phase:** Stabilization (Post-Phase 8)

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Following the completion of Phase 8 (Editor Integration), several warnings, test failures, and a CSS loading error (404) were identified during build, test execution, and runtime. This stabilization effort addressed these issues to ensure a clean build, a fully passing test suite, and correct asset loading.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Vite Build Errors/Warnings:**

- **Error:** `Invalid value "iife" for option "output.format"` and `Invalid value for option "output.file"` were resolved by modifying `Vite.config.js` to use `output.dir` and the `es` format without `inlineDynamicImports`, correctly enabling code splitting for CodeMirror.
- **Warning:** `The emitted file "bundle.css" overwrites a previously emitted file` was resolved by adjusting the `output.file` setting for the CSS build target in `Vite.config.js` to avoid conflicting with the `postcss` plugin's `extract` option.
- **Runtime Error (404):** A `404 Not Found` error for `/static/gen/editor.css` was resolved by adding `postcss-import` to the PostCSS plugin chain in `Vite.config.js` to correctly inline the `@import url('./editor.css');` rule from `src/css/main.css` into the final `bundle.css`.

2. **Pytest Failures/Warnings:**

- **Failure:** `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` in unit tests was resolved by modifying the datetime comparisons in `tests/unit/test_models.py` to use naive UTC datetimes (`datetime.now(timezone.utc).replace(tzinfo=None)`) for comparing against the database's naive timestamps.
- **Warning:** `LegacyAPIWarning: The Query.get() method is considered legacy` was resolved by updating the Flask-Login `user_loader` in `journal/__init__.py` to use `db.session.get()`.
- **Warning:** `SAWarning: Object of type <...> not in session` in routes and tests was resolved by ensuring database objects were added to the session (`db.session.add()`) *before* operations that could trigger SQLAlchemy's autoflush mechanism.
- **Warning:** `DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated` originating from SQLAlchemy internals was filtered by adding a specific ignore rule to `uv run pytest.ini`.

## Outcome

The frontend build process (`bun run build`) now completes without errors or warnings. The test suite (`uv run pytest`) now passes all tests without failures or warnings. Asset loading in the browser is functioning correctly. The project is in a more stable state.

## Next Steps

Proceed with manual testing of the application as previously planned.
