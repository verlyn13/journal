# Phase 14 Started: Documentation Foundation

Phase 14 of the Flask Journal project has officially commenced. This phase focuses on establishing the foundational elements for comprehensive, AI-consumable documentation.

## Phase Goals

As outlined in the [Phase 14 Implementation Plan](@docs/implementation/14-phase-fourteen-documentation-foundation.md), the primary goals are:

1. **Assess Current Documentation:** Conduct a thorough inventory and quality assessment of existing documentation.
2. **Establish JSDoc Infrastructure:** Set up tooling and standards for JavaScript documentation using JSDoc.

## Initial Tasks Delegated

The following tasks have been delegated to the **Documentation Specialist**:

1. **Documentation Inventory & Assessment:**

- Create an inventory spreadsheet of all `.md` files in `docs/`.
- Assess documents against AI-consumable standards.
- Identify priorities for future enhancement.
- Produce an inventory report summarizing findings.

2. **JSDoc Implementation Setup:**

- Install and configure JSDoc.
- Add `npm run docs` script.
- Create a JSDoc standards guide.
- Implement initial JSDoc comments in key JS files.
- Generate and link initial API documentation.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this phase, we expect to have:

- A clear understanding of the current documentation landscape and a prioritized list for improvements.
- A functional JSDoc setup capable of generating API documentation from source code comments.
- Established standards for JSDoc usage within the project.

*Progress on these tasks will be tracked, and a completion status update will be provided once the phase goals are met.*
