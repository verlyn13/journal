# Status Update: Phase 12 Complete (2025-04-08)

Phase 12 of the Flask Journal MVP is complete.

This phase addressed critical issues with the CodeMirror editor integration, including:
*   Fixing the "editorElement not found" JavaScript error.
*   Correcting the CSS layout of the editor toolbar.
*   Implementing a robust asset cache-busting strategy using Rollup, a manifest file, and a Flask context processor.

Details of the implementation, challenges encountered, and the final solutions can be found in the [Phase 12 Summary](../implementation/12-phase-twelve-summary.md).
