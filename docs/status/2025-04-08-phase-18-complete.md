# Phase 18 Complete: Documentation Integration

Phase 18 of the Flask Journal project, focused on integrating documentation practices into the development workflow, is now complete.

## Phase Goals Achieved

1.  **Formalized Documentation Review Process:** The process for reviewing documentation changes alongside code is defined in [`docs/guides/documentation-review-process.md`](@docs/guides/documentation-review-process.md). This includes guidelines on when updates are needed, PR requirements, reviewer responsibilities, and a comprehensive checklist.
2.  **Planned CI/CD Integration:** A proposal for integrating automated documentation checks (Markdown linting, link checking) into the CI/CD pipeline has been created at [`docs/proposals/ci-cd-documentation-checks.md`](@docs/proposals/ci-cd-documentation-checks.md). This document outlines the necessary commands, recommended pipeline placement, and failure handling strategies. The required npm scripts (`lint:md`, `lint:links`) have been added to `package.json`.
3.  **Defined Documentation Maintenance Strategy:** Guidelines and tools for ongoing maintenance are in place:
    *   A checklist for developers is available at [`docs/guides/documentation-update-checklist.md`](@docs/guides/documentation-update-checklist.md).
    *   Metrics for tracking documentation health are defined in [`docs/guides/documentation-metrics.md`](@docs/guides/documentation-metrics.md).
    *   The review process guide also touches on periodic audits.

## Outcome

With the completion of this phase, the project now has:
*   Clearly defined processes for creating, reviewing, and maintaining documentation as part of the standard development lifecycle.
*   A concrete plan for automating documentation quality checks.
*   Tools (checklists, metrics) to support ongoing documentation upkeep.

This concludes the planned documentation-focused phases, establishing a solid foundation for sustainable documentation practices moving forward.
