# Status Update: Phase 10 Complete

**Date:** 2025-04-08

**Phase:** 10 - Favicon Implementation

**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Phase 10 successfully implemented the application's favicon.

## Key Accomplishments

*   **File Relocation:** The `favicon.ico` file was moved from the project root to the `journal/static/` directory.
*   **Template Update:** The `journal/templates/base.html` file was updated to include the standard `<link rel="icon" href="...">` tag pointing to the favicon within the static directory.

## Next Steps

*   Manual verification by loading the application in a browser to confirm the favicon displays correctly.
*   Proceed with further development or deployment tasks.
