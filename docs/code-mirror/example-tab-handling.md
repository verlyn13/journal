# CodeMirror Tab Handling Guide

## Introduction

Tab key handling is an important consideration when implementing a code editor in web applications. This guide explains CodeMirror's approach to Tab key handling and how to configure it appropriately for your use case.

## Default Behavior

By default, CodeMirror **does not** handle the Tab key. This is an intentional design decision to comply with accessibility guidelines, specifically:

> The default configuration passes the "no keyboard trap" criterion of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

This means that users who navigate the web using only a keyboard can naturally move focus in and out of the editor without getting trapped. This is crucial for users who don't have access to pointing devices like mice.

## Accessibility Considerations

When deciding how to handle the Tab key in your editor, consider the following:

1. **Keyboard navigation** is essential for many users, including those with motor disabilities
2. The ability to **escape from focusable inputs** is a requirement for WCAG compliance
3. **Developer expectations** often include Tab performing indentation functions in code editors

## Built-in Escape Mechanisms

CodeMirror provides two built-in escape mechanisms even when Tab is configured for indentation:

1. **Escape followed by Tab**: Pressing Escape and then immediately pressing Tab will always allow the user to exit the editor (the Tab press won't be handled by the editor)

2. **Toggle Tab Focus Mode**: The default keymap binds:

   - `Ctrl-m` on most platforms
   - `Shift-Alt-m` on macOS

   This toggles "tab focus mode" which temporarily disables Tab key handling, allowing normal keyboard navigation

## Configuring Tab for Indentation

If you want to make Tab handle indentation (which is a common expectation in code editors), you can use the `indentWithTab` binding from the commands package.

### Example Implementation

```javascript
import {basicSetup} from "codemirror"
import {EditorView, keymap} from "@codemirror/view"
import {indentWithTab} from "@codemirror/commands"
import {javascript} from "@codemirror/lang-javascript"

const editor = new EditorView({
  doc: `function example() {
  if (true) {
    console.log("indented with tab")
  }
}`,
  extensions: [
    basicSetup,
    keymap.of([indentWithTab]),  // Add tab handling
    javascript()
  ],
  parent: document.querySelector("#editor")
})
```

With this configuration:

- Tab will indent the current line or selection
- Shift-Tab will un-indent
- The escape mechanisms described above will still function

## Best Practices

If you decide to enable Tab for indentation, follow these best practices:

1. **Document the escape mechanisms** in your application's help or documentation

2. **Provide visible indicators** about Tab handling when appropriate

3. **Consider adding a toggle** that allows users to enable/disable Tab handling according to their preferences

4. **Test keyboard navigation flow** to ensure users can still navigate your interface

## Tab vs. Spaces Indentation

When Tab is used for indentation, CodeMirror will still insert spaces by default rather than tab characters, using the editor's configured tab size. This behavior is controlled by:

- The `indentUnit` facet which defines the whitespace for one level of indentation
- The `tabSize` facet which defines the visual width of a tab character

If you want to change this to use actual tab characters, you'll need to customize the indentation functions.

## Temporary Tab Focus Mode

You can also enable a temporary tab focus mode that automatically disables itself after a short time or when another key is pressed:

```javascript
import {EditorView, keymap} from "@codemirror/view"
import {temporarilySetTabFocusMode} from "@codemirror/commands"

// Add this to your extensions array:
keymap.of([{
  key: "Alt-Tab", 
  run: temporarilySetTabFocusMode
}])
```

## Conclusion

While CodeMirror's default behavior of not handling the Tab key might seem surprising at first, it represents a thoughtful balance between accessibility requirements and developer expectations. By understanding and properly implementing Tab handling, you can create a code editor that is both powerful and accessible to all users.

Remember that the most important guideline is to ensure that all users can effectively navigate to, through, and away from your editor component, regardless of their input methods or abilities.
