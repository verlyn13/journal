# Documentation Testing Process

This guide outlines the established processes and tools for testing and validating the quality, consistency, and accuracy of documentation in the Flask Journal project.

## Automated Testing Tools

### Markdown Linting

We use `markdownlint-cli` to enforce consistent styling and formatting across our Markdown documentation. The linter helps catch common Markdown mistakes and ensures a consistent writing style.

#### Configuration

Our markdownlint configuration (.markdownlint.json) includes the following settings:

```json
{
  "default": true,
  "MD013": {
    "line_length": 120,
    "code_blocks": false,
    "tables": false
  },
  "MD024": {
    "siblings_only": true
  },
  "MD033": false,
  "MD041": false
}
```

This configuration:
- Enforces a line length of 120 characters for regular text (excluding code blocks and tables)
- Allows duplicate headings in different sections
- Permits HTML elements when necessary
- Doesn't require the first line to be a top-level heading

#### Running the Linter

To lint all Markdown files in the project:

```bash
npm run lint:md
```

To lint a specific directory:

```bash
npm run lint:md -- docs/guides
```

### Link Validation

We use `markdown-link-check` to validate both internal and external links within our documentation.

#### Running Link Validation

To check links in all Markdown files:

```bash
npm run lint:links
```

To check links in a specific file or directory:

```bash
npm run lint:links -- docs/guides/architecture-overview.md
```

## Manual Review Process

In addition to automated testing, documentation should undergo manual review:

### 1. Peer Review

Documentation changes should be reviewed by at least one other team member with relevant expertise. The reviewer should check for:

- Technical accuracy
- Clarity and comprehensibility
- Proper structure and organization
- Consistency with existing documentation
- Completeness (covers all necessary information)

### 2. Technical Accuracy Verification

For technical documentation:

- The relevant mode specialist (Flask Specialist, Editor Specialist, etc.) should verify that implementation details are accurately represented
- Include code examples that have been tested and confirmed to work
- Ensure all API references match the actual implementation

### 3. AI-Assisted Validation

For complex documentation, consider using AI-assisted validation:

1. Provide the documentation to an AI assistant with a prompt like: "Based solely on this documentation, explain how to [perform a specific task]"
2. Review the AI's response to identify potential gaps or unclear sections
3. Ask the AI to summarize the key points to verify the documentation conveys its intended message

## Documentation Testing Checklist

Before considering documentation complete, verify:

- [ ] Documentation passes markdownlint with no errors
- [ ] All links (internal and external) are valid
- [ ] Content has been peer-reviewed
- [ ] Technical accuracy has been verified by a domain expert
- [ ] Consistent terminology is used throughout
- [ ] Document follows the appropriate template structure
- [ ] Headings create a logical hierarchy
- [ ] Information is organized into retrievable chunks (150-1000 tokens)
- [ ] Appropriate metadata and cross-references are included

## Reporting Issues

When documentation issues are identified:

1. For minor issues (typos, formatting): Fix them directly
2. For content issues: Document the problem and create an improvement plan
3. For structural issues: Discuss with the Documentation Specialist before making major changes

## Continuous Improvement

The documentation testing process should itself be reviewed periodically:

- After each major project milestone, review the documentation testing process
- Collect feedback from team members on documentation usability
- Update linting rules and templates as needed to address common issues

By following this testing process, we ensure our documentation remains high-quality, consistent, and valuable for both users and developers.
