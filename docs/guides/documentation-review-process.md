# Documentation Review Process

This guide formalizes the process for reviewing documentation changes during the development workflow, ensuring that documentation remains accurate, complete, and up-to-date as the application evolves.

## When Documentation Updates Are Required

Documentation updates should be included in the same pull request as code changes in the following scenarios:

### Mandatory Documentation Updates

- **New Features**: When adding new functionality or features
- **API Changes**: When modifying API endpoints, parameters, return values, or behavior
- **User Interface Changes**: When updating UI elements that users interact with
- **Significant Refactoring**: When restructuring code that changes architectural patterns
- **Configuration Changes**: When modifying environment variables, settings, or startup options
- **Database Schema Changes**: When altering database models or relationships
- **Dependency Updates**: When updating libraries or dependencies with new functionality or breaking changes

### Recommended Documentation Updates

- **Bug Fixes**: For critical bugs or those that might affect understanding of the system
- **Performance Improvements**: When optimization techniques should be documented for future reference
- **Error Handling Changes**: When modifying how errors are reported or handled

## Documentation Changes in Pull Requests

### Pre-Pull Request Preparation

1. **Identify Documentation Impact**: Before creating a PR, identify which documentation files need to be updated
2. **Update Documentation**: Make necessary changes to documentation files
3. **Run Automated Tests**: Execute markdown linting and link validation

```bash
# Run Markdown linting to check style and formatting
npm run lint:md

# Run link checking to verify all links are valid
npm run lint:links
```

### Pull Request Contents

Documentation-related PRs should include:

1. **Clear PR Description**: Explain what documentation was updated and why
2. **Link to Related Code Changes**: If applicable, reference the code PR that necessitated documentation updates
3. **Before/After Comparison**: For significant changes, include before/after screenshots or examples
4. **Documentation Testing Results**: Include a summary of linting and link validation results

## Documentation Review Responsibilities

### Review Assignments

| Change Type | Primary Reviewer | Secondary Reviewer |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Technical documentation | Domain specialist | Documentation specialist |
| API documentation | Backend developer | API consumer representative |
| UI/UX documentation | Frontend developer | Designer or UX specialist |
| Developer guides | Peer developer | Documentation specialist |
| User documentation | Documentation specialist | Product manager or user representative |

### Review Timeline

- Documentation reviews should be completed within 2 business days
- For urgent changes, reviewers should be notified directly to expedite the process
- If primary reviewers are unavailable, escalate to team lead for reassignment

## Documentation Review Checklist

Reviewers should verify the following aspects:

### Technical Accuracy

- [ ] All technical details are accurate and reflect the actual implementation
- [ ] Code examples work as documented
- [ ] Command-line instructions are correct and can be executed as written
- [ ] Screenshots and diagrams match the current state of the application

### Structural Quality

- [ ] Documentation follows the appropriate template structure
- [ ] Headings create a logical hierarchy
- [ ] Information is organized into retrievable chunks (150-1000 tokens)
- [ ] Appropriate metadata and cross-references are included

### Content Quality

- [ ] Content is clear, concise, and focused on the target audience
- [ ] Terminology is consistent with project glossary
- [ ] No grammatical errors or typos
- [ ] Avoids ambiguous language and undefined acronyms
- [ ] Explains "why" not just "what" and "how"

### Completeness

- [ ] All relevant aspects of the change are documented
- [ ] Includes prerequisites and dependencies
- [ ] Addresses potential edge cases and errors
- [ ] Links to related documentation are provided
- [ ] Changelog/release notes are updated if applicable

1. **Initial Review**: Documentation changes are first checked by automated tools
2. **Technical Review**: Domain specialist reviews for technical accuracy
3. **Documentation Quality Review**: Documentation specialist reviews for quality and consistency
4. **Revisions**: Author addresses any feedback
5. **Final Approval**: Team lead or documentation specialist provides final approval

## Approval Criteria

Documentation changes can be approved when:

1. All items on the review checklist have been addressed
2. At least one technical reviewer and one documentation quality reviewer have approved
3. All automated tests pass
4. The documentation accurately reflects the accompanying code changes

## Handling Disagreements

If reviewers disagree on documentation approach:

1. Clearly articulate the different perspectives in PR comments
2. Consider the target audience's needs as the primary deciding factor
3. If consensus cannot be reached, escalate to team lead or documentation specialist for final decision
4. Document the decision and rationale for future reference

## Post-Merge Documentation Review

After a significant feature or milestone:

1. Schedule a holistic documentation review session
2. Verify integration of all recent documentation changes
3. Test documentation usability with new team members or users
4. Identify areas for improvement in the next iteration

By following this review process, we ensure that documentation evolves alongside code changes, maintaining its accuracy and usefulness for both developers and users.
