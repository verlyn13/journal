# Phase 14: Documentation Foundation

This phase focuses on establishing the foundational elements for comprehensive, AI-consumable documentation across the Flask Journal project, as outlined in the [Documentation Specialist Execution Plan](@docs/implementation/documentation-specialist-execution-plan.md).

## Goals

1. **Assess Current State:** Gain a clear understanding of existing documentation assets, their quality, and identify areas needing improvement.
2. **Establish JSDoc Infrastructure:** Set up the necessary tooling and standards for documenting JavaScript code using JSDoc.

## Key Tasks

This phase involves two primary sets of tasks, delegated to the Documentation Specialist:

### Task 1: Documentation Inventory & Assessment

- **Objective:** Create a comprehensive overview of all project documentation and assess its quality against AI-consumable standards.
- **Steps:**
- Create an inventory spreadsheet listing all `.md` files within the `docs/` directory.
- Categorize each document (e.g., planning, implementation, status, guide).
- Evaluate each document based on structure, semantic chunking, metadata, and clarity.
- Identify high-priority documents for enhancement in subsequent phases.
- Document specific gaps, inconsistencies, or areas needing improvement.
- **Deliverable:** A documentation inventory spreadsheet and a summary report outlining findings and priorities.

### Task 2: JSDoc Implementation Setup

- **Objective:** Configure the project for JSDoc generation and establish initial standards.
- **Steps:**
- Install `jsdoc` and any necessary templates (e.g., `minami`) as dev dependencies.
- Create and configure `jsdoc.conf.json` pointing to `src/js` and specifying an output directory (e.g., `docs/js-api`).
- Add an `npm run docs` script to `package.json` to execute JSDoc generation.
- Create a `JSDoc Standards Guide` (e.g., `docs/guides/jsdoc-standards.md`) outlining required tags and formatting.
- Implement exemplary JSDoc comments in a few key JavaScript files (e.g., `src/js/main.js`, a utility function).
- Run the `npm run docs` script to generate the initial HTML documentation.
- Add links from relevant markdown documents (e.g., `docs/initial-planning/JSDoc-implementation.md`) to the generated API docs.
- **Deliverable:** Configured JSDoc setup, `npm run docs` script, JSDoc standards guide, initial generated API documentation, and updated links in markdown.

## Coordination

- The **Documentation Specialist** will execute these tasks.
- The **Flask Lead Architect** will review the deliverables (inventory report, JSDoc setup, standards guide) before proceeding to the next phase.

Completion of this phase will provide a solid foundation for systematically improving documentation quality across the entire project.
