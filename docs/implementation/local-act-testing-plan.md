# Plan: Integrating Local GitHub Actions Testing with `act`

## 1. Goal

To improve the stability and reliability of our CI/CD pipeline by enabling developers to test GitHub Actions workflows locally using `act` before pushing changes or opening Pull Requests. This aims to reduce CI failures caused by workflow syntax errors, misconfigurations, or script issues.

## 2. Background

Recent CI build failures highlighted the need for better pre-commit validation of GitHub Actions workflows. The `act` tool allows developers to simulate workflow runs in a local Docker environment, providing faster feedback and catching errors earlier in the development cycle.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### 3.1. Documentation (Lead Architect / Documentation Specialist)

-   **[COMPLETED]** Create a comprehensive reference guide for using `act` within this project: `docs/guides/act-reference.md`.
-   **[COMPLETED]** Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include instructions and expectations for developers to run `act` locally before submitting PRs, linking to the reference guide.

### 3.2. Tooling & Environment Setup (CI/CD Specialist / Developers)

-   **Action:** Ensure all developers have `act` and Docker (or a compatible engine) installed.
-   **Guidance:** Provide support for installation issues via team channels or documentation.
-   **Secrets Management:** Establish a clear process for developers to obtain necessary secrets (like a test `GITHUB_TOKEN` if required for local runs) or configure `act` to use placeholders where appropriate. Document this process.

### 3.3. Workflow Adaptation (CI/CD Specialist)

-   **Review Workflows:** Examine existing workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) for compatibility with `act`. Identify steps that might behave differently locally (e.g., network-dependent steps, steps requiring specific GitHub environment variables not easily simulated).
-   **Add `env.ACT` Checks:** Implement `if: ${{ !env.ACT }}` conditions on steps that should *only* run in the actual GitHub Actions environment (e.g., production deployments, notifications).
-   **Runner Images:** Evaluate if default `act` runner images are sufficient or if specific `-P` flags (using `catthehacker` or `nektos` images) should be recommended or documented for certain workflows to ensure environment parity.

### 3.4. Developer Training & Adoption (Lead Architect / CI/CD Specialist)

-   **Announcement:** Communicate the new requirement and process to the development team.
-   **Training/Demo:** (Optional) Conduct a brief session demonstrating how to use `act` for common scenarios in this project.
-   **Enforcement:** Update PR templates or checklists to include a confirmation that local `act` testing was performed for relevant changes.

## 4. Expected Outcome

-   Reduced frequency of CI failures related to workflow errors.
-   Faster feedback loop for developers working on CI/CD scripts or workflow-related changes.
-   Improved overall quality and reliability of the CI/CD pipeline.

## 5. Timeline

-   **Phase 1 (Documentation & Setup):** Complete within 1-2 days.
-   **Phase 2 (Workflow Adaptation & Training):** Complete within 1 week.
-   **Phase 3 (Adoption & Monitoring):** Ongoing, with review after 1 month.

## 6. Responsibilities

-   **Lead Architect:** Oversee the plan, ensure documentation is clear, facilitate adoption.
-   **CI/CD Specialist:** Lead workflow adaptation, provide technical guidance on `act` and secrets, potentially lead training.
-   **Documentation Specialist:** Ensure `act-reference.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` are up-to-date and clear.
-   **Developers:** Install tools, follow the updated contribution guidelines, run `act` locally, provide feedback.
