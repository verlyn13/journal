# Implementation Summary: Phase 5

## Status: COMPLETE

Phase 5, focusing on **Initial Testing & Basic Scripts**, has been successfully completed according to the plan outlined in [05-phase-five-testing-scripts.md](./05-phase-five-testing-scripts.md).

## Key Deliverables

-   **Unit Tests:**
-   Created `tests/unit/test_models.py` with tests for `User` password handling and basic `Entry` creation/representation.
-   Created `tests/unit/test_forms.py` with tests for validation logic of `RegistrationForm`, `LoginForm`, and `EntryForm`.
-   **Integration Tests:**
-   Created `tests/integration/test_auth.py` covering registration (success, duplicate username/email), login (success, failure), logout, and access control redirection.
-   Created `tests/integration/test_crud.py` covering entry creation, viewing, updating, deletion, access control (ownership, 403), and handling of non-existent entries (404).
-   Added `auth_client` fixture to `tests/conftest.py` for providing an authenticated test client.
-   **Helper Scripts:**
-   Created `scripts/deploy.sh` providing a basic deployment workflow (pull, install, migrate, restart service).
-   Created `scripts/backup.sh` providing a basic SQLite database backup mechanism with timestamping and optional cleanup.
-   Both scripts made executable (`chmod +x`).
-   **Test Execution:** All implemented tests pass (`pytest` command). Coverage is established, providing a baseline for future development.

## Issues Encountered & Resolved During Testing

Implementing the tests revealed several issues that required debugging and correction:

1.  **Missing Dependency (`email-validator`):** The `Email` validator in WTForms requires the `email-validator` package, which was missing.
-   **Resolution:** Added `email-validator` to `requirements.txt` and installed it.
2.  **Application Context Errors (`RuntimeError: Working outside of application context.`):** Many tests failed initially because operations requiring the Flask application context (like `url_for` or form instantiation/validation) were performed outside an active context.
-   **Resolution:** Ensured necessary operations within tests (especially integration tests using `url_for` and unit tests for forms) were wrapped in `with test_app.app_context():`. Removed unnecessary wrappers around `test_client` calls where the client itself manages the context.
3.  **Database Session Errors (`AttributeError: db`, `DetachedInstanceError`, `InvalidRequestError`):** Tests involving database interactions failed due to incorrect handling of the database session or using objects across different sessions.
-   **Resolution:** Corrected tests to consistently use the imported `db` object (`from journal import db`) and access the session via `db.session` within an application context. Modified the `auth_client` fixture to yield the `user_id` instead of the `user` object, requiring tests to re-fetch the user within their own context to avoid detached instances.
4.  **Template Not Found (`_formhelpers.html`):** Tests involving rendering CRUD forms failed because the templates referenced a non-existent helper file.
-   **Resolution:** Removed the unused `{% from "_formhelpers.html" ... %}` import from `create_entry.html` and `edit_entry.html`.
5.  **Timestamp Comparison (`TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes` / `AssertionError`):** The unit test for the `Entry` model's default timestamp failed due to inconsistencies in how timezone-aware datetimes were handled/compared, especially with SQLite.
-   **Resolution:** Updated the `Entry.timestamp` model default to use `DateTime(timezone=True)` and `default=lambda: datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. Modified the corresponding unit test assertion to check if the timestamp is close to the current time within a tolerance (`timedelta`) rather than exact equality or direct comparison, making it less sensitive to minor timing variations in the test environment.
6.  **Flash Message Assertions:** Tests checking for flash messages after redirects failed because the assertion checked the final page content instead of the session *before* the redirect, or because the asserted message text didn't match the actual message/validation error.
-   **Resolution:** Modified tests for duplicate registration checks to assert the form validation error message present in the response HTML (status code 200) instead of expecting a flashed message after a redirect. Corrected asserted flash message text in other tests to match the actual messages defined in the routes.
7.  **Redirect URL Assertion:** The logout test failed when comparing the absolute URL generated by `url_for` with the relative URL in the redirect location.
-   **Resolution:** Modified the assertion to compare only the path component of the URLs.
8.  **Legacy/SQLAlchemy Warnings:** Addressed the `LegacyAPIWarning` for `Query.get()` by changing lookups by primary key to use `db.session.get(Model, id)`. The `SAWarning` about objects not being in the session during autoflush remains but doesn't cause failures.

## Lingering Issues/Warnings

-   **`SAWarning: Object of type <Entry> not in session...`:** This warning appears during some tests involving relationship handling (`User.entries`). It doesn't cause test failures but indicates potential inefficiency or unexpected behavior in SQLAlchemy's autoflush mechanism under specific test conditions. Can be investigated further if it leads to problems.
-   **Test Coverage:** While core paths are tested, coverage is not 100% (currently ~97%). Some branches in routes (e.g., specific error conditions, edge cases in redirects) are not yet covered.

## Next Steps

The core functionality is tested, and basic helper scripts are in place. The project is functionally complete according to the defined MVP scope. Final steps involve:
-   Final code review and minor cleanup.
-   Updating the main `README.md`.
-   Final manual testing of the deployed application (user needs to perform systemd steps).
