# Implementation Plans

This directory contains detailed, step-by-step implementation plans for specific features or components of the Flask Journal MVP. These plans break down the high-level architecture and requirements defined in `docs/initial-planning/` into actionable tasks for development.

Each document should focus on a specific part of the implementation, referencing relevant planning documents and outlining:

*   Required models, views, forms, services.
*   Specific routes and API endpoints.
*   Database schema changes (if any).
*   Frontend component interactions (HTMX/Alpine.js).
*   Testing considerations for the specific feature.
*   Dependencies on other components or tasks.

Refer to the main [Comprehensive Guide](../initial-planning/comprehensive-guide-personal.md) for the overall architecture.
