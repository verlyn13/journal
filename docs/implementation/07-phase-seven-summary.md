# Phase 7 Summary: UI/UX Improvements

**Objective:** Enhance the user interface and experience with improved CSS styling for better visual appeal and usability, implement distinct styling for flash message categories for clearer feedback, and potentially standardize form rendering using macros.

**Status:** Completed successfully.

**Key Implementation Details:**

-   **Flash Messages:**
-   Reviewed `flash()` calls in routes; categories were confirmed to be appropriate.
-   Updated `base.html` to render flash messages using category-specific classes (e.g., `flash-success`).
-   Updated CSS selectors in `main.css` to target the new flash message classes.
-   **CSS Enhancements (`main.css`):**
-   Added general improvements for layout, typography, navigation, forms, and buttons.
-   Added specific styling for tags (`.tag-link`) to render them as badges/pills.
-   **Form Error Styling:**
-   Updated all form templates (`login.html`, `register.html`, `create_entry.html`, `edit_entry.html`) to use a consistent CSS class (`.form-error`) for displaying validation errors, replacing previous inline styles.
-   Added corresponding styles for `.form-error` in `main.css`.
-   **Form Macro:** Decided against implementing a form macro at this stage, as the current rendering was deemed simple and consistent enough after the error styling update.

**Outcome:**

Phase 7 successfully improved the application's visual presentation and user feedback mechanisms. Flash messages are now styled according to their category (success, error, info, warning), form errors are styled consistently, and general CSS enhancements provide a cleaner look and feel. Tag rendering is also improved.
