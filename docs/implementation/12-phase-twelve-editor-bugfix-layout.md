# Implementation Plan: Phase 12 - Editor Bug Fixing & Layout Correction

## Goal

The primary goal of Phase 12 is to fix critical bugs preventing the CodeMirror editor from functioning correctly. This includes resolving the JavaScript error "Editor target element (x-ref='editorElement') not found" and correcting the CSS layout of the editor toolbar to display buttons in a single row.

## Prerequisites

*   Completion of Phase 11 (Editor MVP Feature Completion).
*   Understanding of the editor architecture (CodeMirror, Alpine.js, Jinja2 templates, CSS).
*   Access to browser developer tools for debugging JavaScript and CSS.

## Implementation Steps

**1. Diagnose and Fix "editorElement not found" Error:**

*   **Investigation:**
    *   Verify `{% include 'components/editor.html' %}` is correctly placed within `journal/templates/main/create_entry.html` and `journal/templates/main/edit_entry.html`.
    *   Examine `journal/templates/components/editor.html`. Ensure the `<div ... x-ref="editorElement">` exists and is not conditionally hidden by an `x-if` or similar directive that might be false during initialization.
    *   Review `src/js/editor/alpine-component.js`. Confirm the `init()` function and its use of `$nextTick` are structured correctly. Add console logging (`console.log('Alpine init running'); console.log('Element ref:', this.$refs.editorElement);`) inside the `$nextTick` callback *before* calling `createEditor` to see if the element exists at that point.
*   **Action:** Based on the investigation, apply the necessary fix. This might involve:
    *   Correcting the template include path or placement.
    *   Adjusting conditional rendering logic in the templates.
    *   Potentially adding further delay or checks in the Alpine `init()` if it's a complex timing issue (though `$nextTick` should usually suffice).
*   **Verification:** Load the create/edit entry pages and confirm the JavaScript error is gone from the browser console and the CodeMirror editor appears.

**2. Fix Toolbar Layout:**

*   **File:** `src/css/editor.css` (or potentially `src/css/main.css` if styles are global).
*   **Investigation:** Inspect the `.editor-toolbar` element and its children (`.toolbar-group`, `.cli-modern-button`) using browser developer tools. Identify why they are wrapping to multiple lines.
*   **Action:** Apply CSS rules to `.editor-toolbar` to enforce a single-row layout. Common techniques include:
    ```css
    .editor-toolbar {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: nowrap; /* Prevent wrapping */
        align-items: center; /* Align items vertically */
        /* Add padding, background, etc. as needed */
        overflow-x: auto; /* Add horizontal scroll if needed on small screens */
    }
    /* Adjust spacing for groups/buttons if necessary */
    .toolbar-group {
        display: flex; /* Ensure buttons within a group are also flex items */
        align-items: center;
        margin-right: 10px; /* Example spacing */
    }
    .toolbar-divider {
        /* Style the divider */
        margin: 0 5px;
    }
    ```
*   **Verification:** Load the create/edit entry pages and visually confirm the toolbar buttons are arranged neatly in a single horizontal row. Check responsiveness on smaller screen sizes if `overflow-x: auto` was used.

**3. Rebuild Frontend Assets:**

*   **Action:** Run `npm run build` after completing CSS changes.

## Testing Considerations

*   **Manual Testing:**
    *   Load both `create_entry.html` and `edit_entry.html` pages. Verify the editor loads without JS errors.
    *   Verify the toolbar layout is correct on both pages.
    *   Perform a quick check of previously implemented editor features (mode switching, preview, basic toolbar actions) to ensure they weren't broken by the fixes.
*   **Automated Testing:** Existing tests should still pass. Consider if a simple integration test could check for the presence of the initialized CodeMirror element (`.cm-editor`).

## Next Steps (Post-Phase 12)

*   Perform comprehensive manual testing of all editor functionality.
*   Address any remaining bugs.
*   Consider the overall MVP completion status.
