# Implementation Guide — Overview

This section provides a high‑level overview of the consolidated implementation guide, including goals, phases, and key decisions.

The full Implementation Guide consolidates all phase documentation. To keep the document maintainable, content is being migrated into split sections (this file and siblings) and linked from the umbrella guide.

Scope:
- Goals and constraints for the implementation
- Summary of phases and major outcomes
- Links to Setup, Workflows, Features, and Operations sections

See also:
- Umbrella guide (TOC): `docs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Split sections: Setup, Workflows, Features, Operations
