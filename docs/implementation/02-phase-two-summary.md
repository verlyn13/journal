# Implementation Summary: Phase 2

## Status: COMPLETE

Phase 2, focusing on **Journal Entry CRUD Operations**, has been successfully completed according to the plan outlined in [02-phase-two-entry-crud.md](./02-phase-two-entry-crud.md).

## Key Deliverables

- **`Entry` Model:** Defined in `journal/models/entry.py` with fields (`id`, `title`, `body`, `timestamp`, `user_id`) and relationship to `User` model established in `journal/models/user.py`.
- **Database Migration:** Migration script generated (`migrations/versions/2c34429e3b14_add_entry_model.py`) and applied using `flask db upgrade`.
- **Entry Form:** `EntryForm` created in `journal/main/forms.py` for creating/editing entries.
- **CRUD Routes:** Implemented in `journal/main/routes.py`:
- `index`: Displays user's entries.
- `new_entry`: Handles creation (GET/POST).
- `entry_detail`: Displays a single entry (GET).
- `edit_entry`: Handles updates (GET/POST).
- `delete_entry`: Handles deletion (POST).
- Routes are protected with `@login_required` and enforce ownership checks (abort 403).
- **Templates:**
- `index.html`: Updated to list entries and provide CRUD links/forms.
- `journal/templates/main/entry_detail.html`: Created to display entry details.
- `journal/templates/main/create_entry.html`: Created to render the new entry form.
- `journal/templates/main/edit_entry.html`: Created to render the edit entry form.
- **Bug Fix:** Resolved `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'now' is undefined` by moving the `inject_now` context processor to the application factory (`journal/__init__.py`) for global template access.

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

1. **`flask db migrate` Failure (Environment):** Initial command failed due to missing `FLASK_APP` environment variable in the execution context.

- **Resolution:** Included `export FLASK_APP=run.py` in the command chain.

2. **`flask db migrate` Failure (SQLAlchemy):** Migration failed with `sqlalchemy.exc.NoReferencedTableError` because the `ForeignKey` in `Entry` model referenced `user.id` instead of the correct table name `users.id`.

- **Resolution:** Corrected the `ForeignKey` definition in `journal/models/entry.py` to `db.ForeignKey('users.id')`.

3. **`jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'now' is undefined`:** Error occurred when rendering templates extending `base.html` (like `auth/login.html`) because the `now` variable was only available within the `main` blueprint context.

- **Resolution:** Moved the `inject_now` context processor from `journal/main/__init__.py` to the application factory (`create_app` function in `journal/__init__.py`) to make it globally available.

## Next Steps

The core journal entry management functionality is now implemented. The project is ready for **Phase 3 planning**, which could involve styling, pagination, or other enhancements as defined in the overall MVP scope.
