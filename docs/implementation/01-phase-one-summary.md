# Implementation Summary: Phase 1

## Status: COMPLETE

Phase 1, focusing on **Project Setup & Core Authentication**, has been successfully completed according to the plan outlined in [01-phase-one-setup-auth.md](./01-phase-one-setup-auth.md).

## Key Deliverables

-   **Project Structure:** Standard Flask project layout established.
-   **Core Files:** `run.py`, `config.py`, `.env`, `requirements.txt` created and configured.
-   **Flask App:** Application factory pattern implemented with core extensions (SQLAlchemy, Migrate, LoginManager).
-   **Database:** SQLite database initialized, `User` model created, and initial migration applied via Flask-Migrate.
-   **Authentication:**
-   Registration (`/register`) and Login (`/login`) forms created using Flask-WTF.
-   Routes implemented for registration, login, and logout (`/logout`) using Flask-Login.
-   Password hashing implemented using Werkzeug.
-   **Templates:** Basic Jinja2 templates (`base.html`, `index.html`, `auth/login.html`, `auth/register.html`) created.
-   **Virtual Environment:** `.venv` created and dependencies installed.
-   **Development Server:** Successfully running (`flask run`).

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

1.  **Initial `flask db init` Failure:** Caused by blueprints being imported in `create_app` before they were defined.
-   **Resolution:** Defined basic blueprint instances in `journal/auth/__init__.py` and `journal/main/__init__.py`, and created empty placeholder files (`routes.py`, `forms.py`) to satisfy initial imports.
2.  **`jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'now' is undefined`:** The `{{ now().year }}` call in `base.html` failed because `now` was not available in the template context.
-   **Resolution:** Added a context processor (`inject_now`) to `journal/main/__init__.py` to inject `datetime.utcnow` as `now` into templates rendered by the `main` blueprint.

## Next Steps

The foundational authentication system is in place. The project is ready for **Phase 2 planning**, which typically involves implementing the core `Entry` model and CRUD operations.
